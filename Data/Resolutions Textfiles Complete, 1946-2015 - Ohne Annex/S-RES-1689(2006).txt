Applauding the Government of Liberia's commitment to transparent management of the country's forestry resources for the benefit of Liberians and its reforms in the timber sector, including promulgating Executive Order No. 1, which declared all purported forest concessions null and void; creating a Forest Reform Monitoring Committee (FRMC); placing an internationally-recruited financial controller in the Forestry Development Authority, making progress towards implementing a management contract to ensure transparency in timber operations; establishing a mechanism for civil society to monitor the forestry sector; and drafting new forestry laws and regulations,
