The Security Council,
Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations operation in Cyprus of 15 June 1995 (S/1995/488 and Add.1),
Taking note of his recommendation that the Security Council extend the mandate of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a further period of six months,
Noting that the Government of Cyprus has agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions in the island it is necessary to keep the force in Cyprus beyond 30 June 1995,

Expressing its concern that there has been no progress towards a final political solution,
Noting that no progress has been made on extending the 1989 unmanning agreement,
Noting also that a review of the situation on the Secretary-General's mission of good offices in Cyprus remains in progress and looking forward to receiving a definitive report at an appropriate time,

3. Requests the Secretary-General to keep under review the structure and strength of UNFICYP with a view to its possible restructuring, bearing in mind the possible implications of an agreement on the extension of the 1989 unmanning agreement;
4. Expresses concern about the modernization and upgrading of military forces in the Republic of Cyprus and the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus, urges once again all concerned to commit themselves to such a reduction and to a reduction of defence spending in the Republic of Cyprus to help restore confidence between the parties and as a first step towards the withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces as described in the set of ideas (S/24472, annex), and calls upon the SecretaryGeneral to promote efforts in this direction;
5. Expresses concern also about the failure by the military authorities on both sides to take reciprocal measures to prohibit along the cease-fire lines live ammunition or weapons other than those which are hand-held and to prohibit also the firing of weapons within sight or hearing of the buffer zone, and calls upon those authorities to enter into discussions with UNFICYP on this matter in line with paragraph 3 of resolution 839 (1993) of 11 June 1993;
6. Regrets the failure to reach agreement on the extension of the 1989 unmanning agreement to cover all areas of the buffer zone where the two sides are in close proximity to each other, and calls upon the military authorities on both sides to cooperate urgently with UNFICYP to this end;
7. Urges the leaders of both communities to promote tolerance and reconciliation between the two communities as recommended in the relevant reports of the Secretary-General;
8. Welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to continue contacts with the two leaders, to make every effort to find common ground for the basis for a resumption of direct talks;
9. Reaffirms the importance it attaches to early progress being made on the substance of the Cyprus question and on the implementation of the confidence-building measures as called for in resolution 939 (1994) of 29 July 1994;
10. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report by 10 December 1995 on the implementation of the present resolution and on any obstacles he may have encountered;
11. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
