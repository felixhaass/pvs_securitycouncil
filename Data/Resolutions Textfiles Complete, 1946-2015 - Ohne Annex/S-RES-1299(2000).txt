Decides, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, that the restrictions set out in paragraph 2 of its resolution 1171 (1998) of 5 June 1998 do not apply to the sale or supply of arms and related matériel for the sole use in Sierra Leone of those Member States cooperating with UNAMSIL and the Government of Sierra Leone; 4.
