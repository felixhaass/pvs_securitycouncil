The Security Council,  
Reaffirming all its previous resolutions on the situation in Rwanda, in particular its resolutions 912 (1994)of 21 April 1994 and 918 (1994)of 17 May 1994, which set out the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 31 May 1994 (S/1994/640),  
Bearing in mind the statement made by the President of the Council on 3 May 1994 (S/PRST/1994/22),  
Reaffirming its resolution 868 (1993) of 29 September 1993 on the security of United Nations operations,  
Noting with concern that, to date, the parties have not ceased hostilities, agreed to a cease-fire, or brought an end to the violence and carnage affecting civilians,  
Noting with the gravest concern the reports indicating that acts of genocide have occurred in Rwanda and recalling in this context that genocide constitutes a crime punishable under international law,  
Reiterating its strong condemnation of the ongoing violence in Rwanda and, in particular, the systematic killing of thousands of civilians,  
Expressing its outrage that the perpetrators of these killings have been able to operate and continue operating within Rwanda with impunity,  
Noting that UNAMIR is not to have the role of a buffer force between the two parties,  
Noting also that UNAMIR's expanded military component will continue only as long as and to the extent that it is needed to contribute to the security and protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Rwanda and to provide security, as required, to humanitarian relief operations,  
Underscoring that the internal displacement of some 1.5 million Rwandans facing starvation and disease and the massive exodus of refugees to neighbouring countries constitute a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions,  
Reiterating the importance of the Arusha Peace Agreement as the basis for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Rwanda,  
Commending the countries which have provided humanitarian assistance to Rwandan refugees, as well as emergency aid to alleviate the sufferings of the Rwandan people, and those countries which have contributed troops and logistical support to UNAMIR, and reiterating the urgent need for coordinated international action in this respect,  
Welcoming the cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the contributions of the countries of the region, especially that of the facilitator of the Arusha peace process, and encouraging them to continue their efforts,  
Welcoming the visit to Rwanda and to the region by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,  
Noting the appointment, pursuant to resolution S-3/1 of 25 May 1994 adopted by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, of a Special Rapporteur for Rwanda,
