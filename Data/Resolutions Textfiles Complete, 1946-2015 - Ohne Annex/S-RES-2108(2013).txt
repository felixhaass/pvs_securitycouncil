Distr.: General 27 June 2013

Resolution 2108 (2013)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 6991st meeting, on 27 June 2013
The Security Council,
Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force of 12 June 2013 (S/2013/345), and also reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,
Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously observe the ceasefire,
Concurring with the Secretary-General's findings that the ongoing military activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,
Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement,
Recalling that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF,
Calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF area of operation,
Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of United Nations personnel in recent months, including the detention of 21 UNDOF peacekeepers within the area of limitation on 6 March by armed elements of the Syrian opposition, the detention of four UNDOF peacekeepers within the area of limitation in the vicinity of Al Jamla on 7 May by armed elements of the Syrian opposition, and the detention of three UNTSO observers on 15 May by a group of anti-government armed elements,

4. Calls on all parties to cooperate fully with the operations of UNDOF, to respect its privileges and immunities and to ensure its freedom of movement, as well as the security of and unhindered and immediate access for the United Nations personnel carrying out their mandate, including considering the temporary use of an alternative port of entry and departure, as required, to ensure safe and secure troop rotation activities, in conformity with existing agreements, and welcomes prompt reporting by the Secretary-General to the Security Council and troop-contributing countries of any actions that impede UNDOF's ability to fulfil its mandate;
