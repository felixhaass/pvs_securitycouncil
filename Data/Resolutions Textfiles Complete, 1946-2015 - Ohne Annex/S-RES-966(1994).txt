The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 and all subsequent relevant resolutions including resolution 868 (1993) of 29 September 1993,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 4 December 1994 (S/1994/1376) and his letter dated 7 December 1994 (S/1994/1395),  
Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Angola,  
Reiterating the importance it attaches to the full implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" and relevant Security Council resolutions,  
Encouraged by the signing of the Lusaka Protocol on 20 November 1994, which is a significant step towards the restoration of lasting peace and national reconciliation in Angola,  
Reaffirming its readiness to consider promptly any recommendation from the Secretary-General for an expanded United Nations presence in Angola on condition that the cease-fire is maintained,  
Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the Force Commander and personnel of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), the three observer States to the Angolan Peace Process, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and some neighbouring States, in particular the Government of Zambia, which have resulted in the signing of the Lusaka Protocol and encouraging them to continue their efforts aimed at the full implementation of the "Acordos de Paz", the Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions,  
Declaring that renewed obstruction to or procrastination in the implementation of those accords would be unacceptable,   
Deeply concerned at reports of renewed clashes in Angola after the entry into force of the agreed cease-fire, which cause suffering to the civilian population, and may jeopardize the successful implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and hamper the effective discharge of the mandate of UNAVEM II,  
Reaffirming the obligation of all States to implement fully the provisions of paragraph 19 of resolution 864 (1993),  
Emphasizing that Angolans bear ultimate responsibility for the successful implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" and the Lusaka Protocol,

7.       Encourages the Secretary-General, in order to enhance the verification capabilities of the existing UNAVEM II and as an additional confidence-building measure, to continue to deploy personnel to the countryside, subject to the strict compliance by the parties with the conditions in paragraph 6 above;  
8.       Notes the intention of the Secretary-General to submit a report on the possible mandate for a new United Nations operation in Angola based on his assessment of the circumstances that warrant that, including the maintenance of the cease-fire, such a report to contain a detailed description of the results of his efforts to identify potential troop-contributing countries, the objectives, concept of operations and financial aspects of such an operation, and progress in discussions with the Government of Angola regarding the conclusion of a status-of-forces agreement, and welcomes the contingency planning being done by him in this regard, including the continuation of the consultations with potential troop contributors to assess their willingness to participate in an enlarged peace-keeping operation in Angola;  
9.       Declares its intention to review the role of the United Nations in Angola by 8 February 1995 at the latest, in the light of the above report;
