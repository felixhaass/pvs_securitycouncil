Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions, in particular resolutions 1595 (2005) of 7 April 2005, 1636 (2005) of 31 October 2005 and 1644 (2005) of 15 December 2005,
Reiterating its call for the strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon,

Recalling the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon to the Secretary-General of 13 December 2005 (S/2005/783) requesting inter alia the establishment of a tribunal of an international character to try all those who are found responsible for this terrorist crime and recalling its request to the Secretary-General in its resolution 1644 (2005) to help the Government of Lebanon identify the nature and scope of the international assistance needed in this regard,
Having examined the report of 21 March 2006 submitted by the SecretaryGeneral pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1644 (2005) (S/2006/176), and welcoming the common understanding reached between the Secretariat and the Lebanese authorities on the key issues regarding the establishment and the main features of a possible tribunal,
Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the truth and in holding all those involved in this terrorist attack accountable,
1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General, and requests him to negotiate an agreement with the Government of Lebanon aimed at establishing a tribunal of an international character based on the highest international standards of criminal justice, taking into account the recommendations of his report and the views that have been expressed by Council members;
