Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and stressing that Liberia's progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into law on 5 October 2006, including the resolution of land and tenure rights,
Applauding the Government of Liberia's recent admission as a participant in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,

Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards meeting the conditions set out by paragraph 5 of resolution 1521 (2003), and concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end,

S/RES/1760 (2007)

Requests the Secretary-General to establish, within one month from the date of adoption of this resolution, in consultation with the Committee, for a period of six months, a Panel of Experts consisting of up to three members, with the range of expertise necessary to fulfil the Panel's mandate described in this paragraph, drawing as much as possible on the expertise of the members of the Panel of Experts reappointed pursuant to resolution 1731 (2006), to undertake the following tasks:
(a) To conduct a follow-up assessment mission to Liberia and neighbouring States, in order to investigate and compile a report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003), including any information relevant to the designation by the Committee of the individuals described in paragraph 4 (a) of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004), and including the various sources of financing, such as from natural resources, for the illicit trade of arms;

(d) To assess the Government of Liberia's compliance with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, recalling that resolution 1753 (2007) decided to terminate the measures on diamonds imposed by paragraph 6 of resolution 1521 (2003) and renewed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1731 (2006);
(e) To report to the Council through the Committee by 6 December 2007 on all the issues listed in this paragraph, and to provide informal updates to the Committee as appropriate before that date;
