Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President relating to the situation in Burundi and in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in particular its resolution 1650 (2005) of 21 December 2005 and resolution 1669 (2006) of 10 April 2006,
Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Burundi, and recalling the importance of the principles of good-neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the relations among States in the region,
Congratulating again the people of Burundi on the successful conclusion of the transitional period and the peaceful transfer of authority to a representative and democratically elected government and institutions,
Welcoming the ongoing negotiations between the Burundian Government and the Palipehutu-FNL which have been facilitated by South Africa and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi, and looking forward to the early conclusion of a comprehensive ceasefire agreement,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on ONUB dated 21 June 2006 (S/2006/429),
