Reaffirming all its previous resolutions on the situation in Rwanda, in particular its resolutions 912 (1994)of 21 April 1994, 918 (1994)of 17 May 1994 and 925 (1994) of 8 June 1994, which set out the mandate and force level of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),  
Determined to contribute to the resumption of the process of political settlement under the Arusha Peace Agreement and encouraging the Secretary- General and his Special Representative for Rwanda to continue and redouble their efforts at the national, regional and international levels to promote these objectives,  
Stressing the importance of the cooperation of all parties for the fulfilment of the objectives of the United Nations in Rwanda,  
Having considered the letter of the Secretary-General of 19 June 1994 (S/1994/728),  
Taking into account the time needed to gather the necessary resources for the effective deployment of UNAMIR, as expanded in resolutions 918 (1994)and 925 (1994) ,  
Noting the offer by Member States to cooperate with the Secretary-General towards the fulfilment of the objectives of the United Nations in Rwanda (S/1994/734), and stressing the strictly humanitarian character of this operation which shall be conducted in an impartial and neutral fashion, and shall not constitute an inter-position force between the parties,  
Welcoming the cooperation between the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and neighbouring States to bring peace to Rwanda,  
Deeply concerned by the continuation of systematic and widespread killings of the civilian population in Rwanda,  
Recognizing that the current situation in Rwanda constitutes a unique case which demands an urgent response by the international community,  
Determining that the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in Rwanda constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region,  
1.       Welcomes the Secretary-General's letter dated 19 June 1994 (S/1994/728) and agrees that a multinational operation may be set up for humanitarian purposes in Rwanda until UNAMIR is brought up to the necessary strength;  
2.       Welcomes also the offer by Member States (S/1994/734) to cooperate with the Secretary-General in order to achieve the objectives of the United Nations in Rwanda through the establishment of a temporary operation under national command and control aimed at contributing, in an impartial way, to the security and protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Rwanda, on the understanding that the costs of implementing the offer will be borne by the Member States concerned;  
3.       Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, authorizes the Member States cooperating with the Secretary-General to conduct the operation referred to in paragraph 2 above using all necessary means to achieve the humanitarian objectives set out in subparagraphs 4 (a) and (b) of resolution 925 (1994) ;  
4.       Decides that the mission of Member States cooperating with the Secretary-General will be limited to a period of two months following the adoption of the present resolution, unless the Secretary-General determines at an earlier date that the expanded UNAMIR is able to carry out its mandate;  
5.       Commends the offers already made by Member States of troops for the expanded UNAMIR;  
6.       Calls upon all Member States to respond urgently to the Secretary- General's request for resources, including logistical support, in order to enable expanded UNAMIR to fulfil its mandate effectively as soon as possible and requests the Secretary-General to identify and coordinate the supply of the essential equipment required by troops committed to the expanded UNAMIR;  
7.       Welcomes, in this respect, the offers already made by Member States of equipment for troop contributors to UNAMIR and calls on other Members to offer such support, including the possibility of comprehensive provision of equipment to specific troop contributors, to speed UNAMIR's expanded force deployment;  
8.       Requests Member States cooperating with the Secretary-General to coordinate closely with UNAMIR and also requests the Secretary-General to set up appropriate mechanisms to this end;  
9.       Demands that all parties to the conflict and others concerned immediately bring to an end all killings of civilian populations in areas under their control and allow Member States cooperating with the Secretary- General to implement fully the mission set forth in paragraph 3 above;  
10.     Requests the States concerned and the Secretary-General, as appropriate, to report to the Council on a regular basis, the first such report to be made no later than fifteen days after the adoption of this resolution, on the implementation of this operation and the progress made towards the fulfilment of the objectives referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above;  
11.     Also requests the Secretary-General to report on the progress made towards completing the deployment of the expanded UNAMIR within the framework of the report due no later than 9 August 1994 under paragraph 17 of resolution 925 (1994) , as well as on progress towards the resumption of the process of political settlement under the Arusha Peace Agreement;  
12.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
