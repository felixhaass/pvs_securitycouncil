Resolution 2245 (2015)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 7551st meeting, on 9 November 2015
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia,
Taking note of the Secretary-General's letter of 7 October 2015 covering United Nations support activities in Somalia ("the Secretary-General's letter" S/2015/762),
Taking note of the African Union Peace and Security Council's 18 September 2015 communiqué on UNSOA,
Noting with appreciation the positive contributions that the UN Support Office to AMISOM (UNSOA) has made to supporting the gains made by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), and underscoring that such contributions are evidence of a successful partnership between the United Nations, the African Union and Member States in Somalia,
Expressing further its gratitude to AMISOM and Somali National Army (SNA) personnel for the sacrifices which they have made in the fight against Al Shabaab,
Expressing concern at the Secretary-General's finding that despite the innovation and best efforts of UNSOA, its resources and resultant capacities have not been able to keep pace with the dramatic expansion of the requested logistical support and that there is a progressively widening gap between the logistical support UNSOA is requested to deliver and its capacity to deliver,
Welcoming the observations and recommendations of the Secretary-General to address gaps in UNSOA's ability to deliver, and further welcoming the steps already being taken and urging their full implementation as a matter of urgency,
1. Emphasizes the role and impact of a responsive, effective, efficient and responsible field support platform as a strategic enabler in Somalia, and in view of the expansion of UNSOA's mission since its establishment in 2009, decides that UNSOA shall bear the name of the UN Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) (and which will be responsible for support to AMISOM, UNSOM and the Somali National Army on joint operations with AMISOM);
