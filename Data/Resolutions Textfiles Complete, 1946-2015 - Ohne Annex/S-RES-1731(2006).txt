Welcoming the sustained progress made by the Government of Liberia since January 2006, in rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support of the international community,
Recalling its decision not to renew the measures in paragraph 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) regarding round log and timber products originating in Liberia, and stressing that Liberia's progress in the timber sector must continue with the effective implementation and enforcement of the National Forestry Reform Law signed into law on 5 October 2006, including the resolution of land and tenure rights,
Welcoming the Government of Liberia's continuing cooperation with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and noting Liberia's progress towards putting in place the necessary internal controls and other requirements in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Kimberley Process,
Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in improving security through Liberia and helping the new Government establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond and timber-producing regions, and border areas,
Recognizing the need for newly vetted and trained Liberian security forces to assume greater responsibility for national security, and taking note of the need for Liberian armed forces to procure humanitarian, medical and/or training equipment,
Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia dated 20 December 2006 (S/2006/976), including on the issues of diamonds, timber, rubber, and arms,
Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2, 4, and 6 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards meeting the conditions set out by paragraphs 5 and 7 of resolution 1521 (2003), and concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end,
