Taking note of the continued efforts of the OAU to ensure Sudan's compliance with the requests of the Central Organ of the OAU, and regretting that the Government of Sudan has not responded adequately to the efforts of the OAU,
Deeply alarmed that the Government of Sudan has failed to comply with the requests set out in paragraph 4 of resolution 1044 (1996) as reaffirmed in paragraph 1 of resolution 1054 (1996),
Reaffirming that the suppression of acts of international terrorism, including those in which States are involved is essential for the maintenance of international peace and security,
Determining that the non-compliance by the Government of Sudan with the requests set out in paragraph 4 of resolution 1044 (1996) as reaffirmed in paragraph 1 of resolution 1054 (1996) constitutes a threat to international peace and security,
Determined to eliminate international terrorism and to ensure the effective implementation of resolutions 1044 (1996) and 1054 (1996), and to that end acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Demands once again that the Government of Sudan comply fully and without further delay with the requests set out in paragraph 4 of resolution 1044 (1996) as reaffirmed in paragraph 1 of resolution 1054 (1996);
2. Notes the steps taken by some Member States to give effect to the provisions set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 1054 (1996), and requests those States that have not yet done so to report to the Secretary-General as soon as possible on the steps they have taken to that end;
3. Decides that all States shall deny aircraft permission to take off from, land in, or overfly their territories if the aircraft is registered in Sudan, or owned, leased or operated by or on behalf of Sudan Airways or by any undertaking, wherever located or organized, which is substantially owned or controlled by Sudan Airways, or owned, leased or operated by the Government or public authorities of Sudan, or by an undertaking, wherever located or organized, which is substantially owned or controlled by the Government or public authorities of Sudan;
4. Further decides that it shall, 90 days after the date of adoption of this resolution, determine the date of entry into force of the provisions set out in paragraph 3 above and all aspects of the modalities of its implementation, unless the Council decides before then, on the basis of a report presented by the Secretary-General, on the compliance of Sudan with the demand in paragraph 1 above;
5. Requests the Secretary-General, by 15 November 1996, to submit a report on the compliance of Sudan with the provisions of paragraph 1 above;
6. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
