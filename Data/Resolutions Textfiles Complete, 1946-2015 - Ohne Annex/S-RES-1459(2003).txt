Highlighting further the importance of conflict prevention through efforts to hinder the fuelling of conflicts by illicit trade in rough diamonds, which is the very nature of the Kimberley Process,
Noting in particular the importance of the major diamond producing, and trading, and processing countries participating in the Kimberley Process system of self-regulation,
Expressing its appreciation to the Governments of South Africa, Namibia, Belgium, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Angola, Botswana, Canada and Switzerland for hosting meetings of the Kimberley Process,
Noting with appreciation the important contribution made by industry and civil society to the development of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,
