Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and the commitments of the 1998 Twentieth Special Session of the General Assembly on Narcotic Drugs, including to work closely with the United Nations Drug Control Programme,
Noting that the Taliban benefits directly from the cultivation of illicit opium by imposing a tax on its production and indirectly benefits from the processing and trafficking of such opium, and recognizing that these substantial resources strengthen the Taliban's capacity to harbour terrorists,

Stressing its determination to ensure respect for its resolutions,
