Resolution 1789 (2007)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5803rd meeting, on 14 December 2007
The Security Council,
Welcoming the analysis on developments on the ground over the last six months in the report of the Secretary-General of 3 December 2007 (S/2007/699) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, in accordance with his mandate,
Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions on the island it is necessary to keep UNFICYP beyond 15 December 2007,
Echoing the Secretary-General's firm belief that the responsibility of finding a solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, that the upcoming year offers an important window of opportunity to make decisive progress, which must be grasped by all parties, in the search for a comprehensive solution, and noting the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement,
Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security situation on the island and along the Green Line remains generally stable, welcoming the decrease in the overall number of incidents involving the two sides, and urging both sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in tension,
Underlining that activity in the buffer zone, in particular proposals for largescale commercial projects, which are not compatible with returning to normal conditions as expressed in the UNFICYP mandate, should not be at the expense of stability and security; reiterating the Secretary-General's firm belief that the situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aidememoire used by the United Nations,
Welcoming the principles and decisions enshrined in the 8 July 2006 Agreement, stressing that a comprehensive settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation and political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, is both desirable and possible and should not be further delayed,
Deploring the continued failure to date to implement the 8 July 2006 Agreement, and urging the leaders of both communities to act to start the process

without delay in order to prepare the ground for fully fledged negotiations leading to a comprehensive and durable settlement,
Welcoming the agreement to allow European Union funds to support demining activities; urging the rapid finalization of the protocol between the relevant parties governing the remaining demining activities in order to complete demining of the buffer zone,
Welcoming the progress and continuation of the important activities of the Committee on Missing Persons; expressing the hope that this process will promote reconciliation between the communities,
Welcoming the proposed confidence-building measures advanced by both sides, as a means of creating greater trust between the two communities and encouraging their early implementation; encouraging also progress on measures such as the opening of additional crossing points including, but not limited to, at Ledra Street, taking into account the arrangements already in place at existing crossing points, and reaffirming the importance of continued crossing of the Green Line by Cypriots,
Welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, urging the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil society and the encouragement of cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles to such contacts,
Agreeing that an active and flourishing civil society is essential to the political process and expressing concern, in this respect, that opportunities for constructive public debate about the future of the island, within and between the communities, are becoming fewer, and that this atmosphere is hampering, in particular, efforts to foster bicommunal activities intended to benefit all Cypriots, and to promote reconciliation and build trust in order to facilitate a comprehensive settlement,
Reaffirming the importance of the Secretary-General continuing to keep the operations of UNFICYP under close review while continuing to take into account developments on the ground and the views of the parties, and reverting to the Council with recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to UNFICYP's mandate, force levels and concept of operation as soon as warranted,
Welcoming the steps taken by the Republic of Cyprus to address the living conditions of many UNFICYP troops,
Echoing the Secretary-General's gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries and organizations,
