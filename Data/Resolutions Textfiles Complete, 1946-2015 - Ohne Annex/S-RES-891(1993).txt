The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 812 (1993) of 12 March 1993 and 846 (1993) of 22 June 1993,  
Recalling its resolution 872 (1993) of 5 October 1993 establishing the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),  
Having examined the Secretary-General's report (S/26878) dated 15 December 1993,  
Welcoming the substantial results obtained by the deployment of the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR),  
Endorsing the Secretary-General's view, shared by the Governments of Uganda and Rwanda, that UNOMUR has been a factor of stability in the area and that it is playing a useful role as a confidence-building mechanism,  
1.       Welcomes the Secretary-General's report (S/26878);  
2.       Decides to extend the mandate of UNOMUR for a period of six months, as envisaged in Security Council resolution 846 (1993) ;  
3.       Notes that the integration of UNOMUR within UNAMIR is purely administrative in nature and that it will in no way affect the mandate of UNOMUR as set out in resolution 846 (1993) ;  
4.       Expresses its appreciation to the Government of Uganda for its cooperation and support for UNOMUR;  
5.       Underlines the importance of civilian and military authorities in the mission area continuing to have a cooperative attitude;  
6.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
