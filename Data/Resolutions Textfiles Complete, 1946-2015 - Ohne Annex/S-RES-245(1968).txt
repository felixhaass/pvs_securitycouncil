The Security Council,  
Taking note of General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966, by which the Assembly terminated South Africa's Mandate over South West Africa and decided, inter alia, that South Africa has no other right to administer the Territory and that henceforth South West Africa comes under the direct responsibility of the United Nations,  
Taking note further of General Assembly resolution 2324 (XXII) of 16 December 1967, in which the Assembly condemned the illegal arrest, deportation and trial at Pretoria of thirty-seven South West Africans as a flagrant violation by the Government of South Africa of their rights, of the international status of the Territory and of General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI),  
Gravely concerned that the Government of South Africa has ignored world public opinion so overwhelmingly expressed in General Assembly resolution 2324 (XXII) by refusing to discontinue this illegal trial and to release and repatriate the South African concerned,  
Taking into consideration the letter of 23 January 1968 from the President of the United Nations Council for South West Africa (S/8353),[1]  
Noting with great concern that the trial is being held under arbitrary laws whose application has been illegally extended the Territory of South West Africa in defiance of General Assembly resolutions,  
Mindful of the grave consequences of the continued illegal application of these arbitrary laws by the Government of South Africa to the Territory of South West Africa,  
Conscious of the special responsibilities of the United Nations towards the people and Territory of South West Africa,  
1.         Condemns the refusal of the Government of South Africa to comply with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 2324 (XXII);  
2.         Calls upon the Government of South Africa to discontinue forthwith this illegal trial and to release and repatriate the South West Africans concerned;  
3.         Invites all States to exert their influence in order to induce the Government of South Africa to comply with the provisions of the present resolution;  
4.         Requests the Secretary-General to follow closely the implementation of the present resolution and to report thereon to the Security Council at the earliest possible date;  
5.         Decides to remain actively seized of the matter:  
Adopted unanimously at the 1387th meeting.
