The Security Council,
Affirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of both Djibouti and Eritrea, and recalling the importance of the principles of good-neighbourliness, non-interference and regional cooperation,
Recalling that in the statement of its President dated 12 June 2008 (S/PRST/2008/20) it condemned Eritrea's military action against Djibouti in Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island and called upon the two parties to show maximum restraint and withdraw forces to the status quo ante,
Taking note of the letter of the Secretary-General dated 11 September 2008 (S/2008/602) in which he transmitted the report of the fact-finding mission he sent following its 5924th meeting (S/PV.5924),
Expressing its deep concern that, as mentioned in the report of the fact-finding mission referred to above, Eritrea has not withdrawn its forces to the status quo ante, as called for by the Security Council in the statement of its President dated 12 June 2008 (S/PRST/2008/20),
Reiterating its serious concern at the absence of dialogue between the two parties, and at the refusal of Eritrea so far to engage in dialogue, or to accept bilateral contacts, mediation or facilitation efforts by subregional or regional organizations or to respond positively to the efforts of the Secretary-General,
Noting that Djibouti has withdrawn its forces to the status quo ante and has cooperated fully with the fact-finding mission mentioned above, as well as with other missions sent by subregional and regional organizations,
Taking note of the first visit to Asmara, since the conflict of June 2008, of the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union in October 2008,
Expressing its deep concern about the continuing tense border dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea and over the possible impact of the grave and unstable security situation in the area of Doumeira on subregional stability and security after the serious incidents of 10 June 2008, which led to dozens of deaths and wounded,
