Having considered the report of the Secretary-General (S/26434 and Add.1) dated 13 September 1993,  
Expressing grave concern at the continuing deterioration of the political and military situation, and noting with consternation the further deterioration of an already grave humanitarian situation,  
Deeply concerned that, despite its previous resolutions and the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, the peace talks remain suspended and a cease-fire has not been established,  
Welcoming the joint statement issued in Lisbon on 10 September 1992 by the representatives of Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, the three observer States to the Angolan peace process,  
Welcoming also and supporting to that end the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative aimed at the earliest resolution of the Angolan crisis through negotiations, and stressing the importance it attaches thereto,  
Welcoming further the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of Heads of State of neighbouring countries to facilitate the resumption of the peace process in Angola,  
Emphasizing the importance of a continued and effective United Nations presence in Angola with a view to fostering the peace process and advancing the full implementation of the Acordos de Paz,  
Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Angola,
