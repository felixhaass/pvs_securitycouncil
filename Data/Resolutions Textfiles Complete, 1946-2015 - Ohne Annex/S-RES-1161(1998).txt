RESOLUTION 1161 (1998)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3870th meeting, on 9 April 1998

The Security Council,
Recalling all its previous resolutions on the situation in Rwanda, in particular its resolutions 918 (1994) of 17 May 1994, 997 (1995) of 9 June 1995, 1011 (1995) of 16 August 1995, 1013 (1995) of 7 September 1995 and 1053 (1996) of 23 April 1996,
Condemning the continuing violence in Rwanda, including the massacre of civilians, including refugees, at Mudende in December 1997, and similar acts of violence observed in the Great Lakes region, including in Burundi,
Expressing grave concern at reports of the sale and supply of arms and related matériel to the former Rwandan government forces and militias, in violation of the embargo imposed under its resolutions 918 (1994), 997 (1995) and 1011 (1995), and underlining the need for Governments to take action to ensure the effective implementation of the embargo,
Commending the members of the International Commission of Inquiry established by resolution 1013 (1995) on the investigation they conducted and, in particular on their final report (S/1997/1010) and its addendum (S/1998/63),
Noting that widespread violence in the eastern region of the former Zaire in October 1996 caused the suspension of effective follow-up to the work of the Commission, but recognizing the need for a renewed investigation of the illegal flow of arms to Rwanda, which is fuelling violence and could lead to further acts of genocide, with specific recommendations to the Security Council for action,
Reaffirming the need for a long-term solution to the refugee and related problems in the territories of States of the Great Lakes region,
Reaffirming also the importance of countering radio broadcasts and pamphlets which spread hate and fear in the region, and emphasizing the need for States to assist countries in the region to counter such broadcasts and publications,
