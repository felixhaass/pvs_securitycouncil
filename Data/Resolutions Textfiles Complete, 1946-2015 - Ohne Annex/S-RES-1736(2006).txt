Paying tribute again to the citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the remarkable commitment they have demonstrated to the democratic process,
Taking note of the letter of the Secretary-General dated 15 November 2006 (S/2006/892), and of the recommendation it contains,
Noting that the 50 military observers deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the authorized military strength of the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) pursuant to resolutions 1669 (2006) and 1692 (2006) have successfully performed observation tasks related to the electoral process and will be repatriated by 31 December 2006,

Deploring the persistence of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular those carried out by these militias and foreign armed groups and by elements of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), and stressing the urgent need for those responsible for these crimes to be brought to justice,
Bearing in mind that the mandates of ONUB and of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) will expire respectively on 31 December 2006 and on 15 February 2007,
Looking forward to the Secretary-General's proposals, after close consultations with the new Congolese authorities, regarding MONUC's future mandate, including a review of the Mission's military strength,
