Distr. GENERAL S/RES/987 (1995) 19 April 1995

RESOLUTION 987 (1995)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3521st meeting, on 19 April 1995
The Security Council,
Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions on the conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and reaffirming in this context its resolution 982 (1995) of 31 March 1995 and in particular its paragraphs 6 and 7,
Expressing its grave concern at the continued fighting in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the agreements on a cease-fire and on the complete cessation of hostilities concluded on 23 and 31 December 1994 (S/1995/8), and deploring the violations of these agreements and of the ban imposed by its resolutions 781 (1992) of 9 October 1992 and 816 (1993) of 31 March 1993 by whomsoever committed,
Stressing the unacceptability of all attempts to resolve the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by military means,
Noting once again the need for resumed negotiations aimed at an overall peaceful settlement of the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of the acceptance of the Contact Group peace plan as a startingpoint,
Gravely preoccupied at the recent attacks on the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) personnel in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and at the fatalities resulting therefrom, condemning in the strongest terms such unacceptable acts directed at members of peace-keeping forces and determined to obtain a strict respect of the status of United Nations personnel in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Reaffirming its determination to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and its freedom of movement for all its missions, and, to these ends, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
