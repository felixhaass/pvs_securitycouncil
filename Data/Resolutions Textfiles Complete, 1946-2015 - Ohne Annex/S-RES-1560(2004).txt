Resolution 1560 (2004)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5032nd meeting, on 14 September 2004
The Security Council,
Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein, including in particular resolution 1531 (2004) of 12 March 2004,
Stressing its unwavering commitment to the peace process, including through the role played by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), and to the full and expeditious implementation of the Comprehensive peace agreement signed by the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter referred to as "the parties") on 12 December 2000 and the preceding Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities of 18 June 2000 (S/2000/1183 and S/2000/601, respectively, hereinafter referred to as the "Algiers Agreements"), and the delimitation decision by the Boundary Commission of 13 April 2002 (S/2000/423), embraced by the parties as final and binding in accordance with the Algiers Agreements,
Recalling that lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as in the region cannot be achieved without the full demarcation of the border between the parties,
Noting with concern in this regard the lack of progress made in the demarcation of the border, as reflected in the Fourteenth report on the work of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission of 20 August 2004, which concludes that under the present circumstances the Commission is unable to progress with demarcation activities,
Expressing its concern about Ethiopia's ongoing rejection of significant parts of the Boundary Commission's decision, and its current lack of cooperation with the Boundary Commission,
Expressing disappointment about the continuing refusal of Eritrea to engage with the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Ethiopia and Eritrea, whose good offices represent a concrete opportunity for both parties to move the peace process forward,
Recalling the recent increase in United Nations Peacekeeping activities and the need to allocate peacekeeping resources in the most effective manner, and recalling in this regard the additional burden caused by the delays in the demarcation process,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/708) and fully supporting the observations made therein,
