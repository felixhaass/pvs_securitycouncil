Distr. GENERAL S/RES/1129 (1997) 12 September 1997

RESOLUTION 1129 (1997)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3817th meeting, on 12 September 1997
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and, in particular, its resolutions 986 (1995) of 14 April 1995 and 1111 (1997) of 4 June 1997,
Reaffirming that the implementation period of resolution 1111 (1997) began at 00.01, Eastern Daylight Time, on 8 June 1997, and that the export of petroleum and petroleum products by Iraq pursuant to resolution 1111 (1997) did not require the approval by the Secretary-General of the distribution plan mentioned in paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of resolution 986 (1995),
Taking note of the decision by the Government of Iraq not to export petroleum and petroleum products permitted pursuant to resolution 1111 (1997) during the period 8 June to 13 August 1997,
Deeply concerned about the resulting humanitarian consequences for the Iraqi people, since the shortfall in the revenue from the sale of petroleum and petroleum products will delay the provision of humanitarian relief and create hardship for the Iraqi people,
Noting that, as set out in the report of the Committee established by resolution 661 (1990) (S/1997/692), Iraq will not be able to export petroleum and petroleum products worth two billion United States dollars by the end of the period set by resolution 1111 (1997) while complying with the requirement not to produce a sum exceeding one billion United States dollars every 90 days set out in paragraph 1 of resolution 986 (1995) and renewed in resolution 1111 (1997),
Acknowledging the situation with regard to the delivery of humanitarian goods to Iraq as described in the report of the Secretary-General (S/1997/685) and encouraging the continuing efforts to improve this situation,
Stressing the importance of an equitable distribution of humanitarian goods as called for by paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of resolution 986 (1995),
