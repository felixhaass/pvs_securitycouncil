Distr.: General 11 June 2003

Resolution 1486 (2003)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4771st meeting, on 11 June 2003
The Security Council,
Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 27 May 2003 (S/2003/572) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, and in particular the call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue of missing persons with due urgency and seriousness,
Noting that the Government of Cyprus has agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions in the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 15 June 2003,
Welcoming and encouraging efforts by the United Nations to sensitize peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,
1. Reaffirms all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, and in particular resolution 1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions;
2. Decides to extend the mandate of UNFICYP for a further period ending 15 December 2003;
3. Endorses the increase of the UNFICYP civilian police component by no more than 34 officers in order to meet the increased workload resulting from the welcome partial easing of restrictions on island-wide freedom of movement, which has been met by goodwill from Greek and Turkish Cypriots;
4. Notes the limited steps taken by the Turkish Cypriot side to ease some of the restrictions imposed on 30 June 2000 on the operation of UNFICYP, but urges the Turkish Cypriot side and the Turkish forces to rescind all remaining restrictions on UNFICYP;
5. Expresses concern at the recent, further violations by the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces at Strovilia and urges them to restore the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000;
6. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report by 1 December 2003 on the implementation of this resolution;
7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
