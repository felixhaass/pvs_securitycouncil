Resolution 1425 (2002)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4580th meeting, on 22 July 2002
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular on the weapon and military equipment embargo established by paragraph 5 of resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the "arms embargo"), resolution 1407 (2002) of 3 May 2002, and the statement of its President of 28 March 2002 (S/PRST/2002/8),
Noting with serious concern the continued flow of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through Somalia from sources outside the country, in contravention of the arms embargo, which is severely undermining peace and security and the political efforts for national reconciliation in Somalia,

Underlining the role of the Intergovernmental Authority of Development (IGAD), in particular the frontline States (Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya), in bringing lasting peace to Somalia, and expressing its support and expectation that the planned National Reconciliation Conference for Somalia to be held in Nairobi will move forward as a matter of urgency and with the pragmatic and result-oriented involvement of the frontline States,
Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 27 June 2002 (S/2002/709) and the report of the expert team appointed by the Secretary-General (S/2002/722), detailing the resources and expertise required for a Panel of Experts to generate independent information on the violations and for improving the enforcement of the arms embargo, in accordance with resolution 1407 (2002),
