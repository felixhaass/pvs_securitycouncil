The Security Council,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 1 July 1993 (S/26023 and Adds.2),  
Recalling the statements made by the President of the Security Council on 10 September 1992, 8 October 1992 and 29 January 1993 concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia (S/24542, S/24637 and S/25198),  
Recalling the Moscow Agreement of 3 September 1992 (S/24523),  
Endorsing the approach set out in the Secretary-General's letter of 5 May 1993 to the President of the Security Council (S/25756),  
Noting with concern the recent intensification of fighting around Sukhumi,  
Reaffirming the statement made by the President of the Security Council on 2 July 1993 (S/26032), which called in particular on all parties to respect the cease-fire agreement of 14 May 1993,  
Stressing the importance it attaches, in the context of the deployment of military observers, to the existence and implementation of a cease-fire and a peace process with the effective involvement of the United Nations,  
1.       Notes with appreciation the observations contained in the Secretary-General's report;  
2.       Requests the Secretary-General to send his Special Envoy to the region to assist in reaching agreement on the implementation of the cease-fire, and to begin immediately the necessary preparations, including contacting Member States which may be able to make observers available and sending a planning team to the area, for the dispatch of 50 military observers to Georgia once the cease-fire is implemented;  
3.       Further requests the Secretary-General to notify the Council, for its decision, when the cease-fire has been implemented and in his view conditions permit the deployment of the observers, and to make recommendations at the stage for their mandate, and declares its readiness to act expeditiously upon such notification;  
4.       Welcomes in this context the Secretary-General's continuing efforts to launch a peace process involving the parties to the conflict and with the participation of the Government of the Russian Federation as a facilitator.  
5.       Supports the Secretary-General's continuing cooperation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in their efforts to bring peace to the region;  
6.       Calls on the Government of the Republic of Georgia to enter expeditiously into discussion with the United Nations on a status of forces agreement to facilitate early deployment of observers when the Council so decides;  
7.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
