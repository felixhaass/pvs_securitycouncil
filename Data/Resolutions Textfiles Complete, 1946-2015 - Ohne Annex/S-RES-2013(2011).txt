The Security Council,
Taking note of the letter to the President of the Council from the SecretaryGeneral dated 30 September 2011 (S/2011/609), attaching a letter from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("the International Tribunal") dated 26 September 2011,

Recalling also its resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010, establishing the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals ("the Mechanism") and requesting the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to expeditiously complete all its remaining work no later than 31 December 2014, prepare its closure and ensure a smooth transition to the Mechanism,
Noting that, upon the completion of the cases to which they are assigned, four permanent judges will be redeployed from the Trial Chambers to the Appeals Chamber and two permanent judges will leave the International Tribunal,
Urging the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete its work expeditiously as requested in resolution 1966 (2010),
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Decides, in light of the exceptional circumstances, that notwithstanding article 12 bis, paragraph 3, of the Statute of the International Tribunal, Judge Bakhtiyar Tuzmukhamedov may work part-time and engage in another judicial occupation until 31 December 2011, and takes note of Judge Tuzmukhamedov's commitment to ensuring timely delivery of judgment in the two cases in which he is currently involved;
