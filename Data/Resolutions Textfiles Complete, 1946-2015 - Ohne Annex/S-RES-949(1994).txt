Recalling that Iraq's acceptance of resolution 687 (1991) adopted pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations forms the basis of the cease-fire,  
Noting past Iraqi threats and instances of actual use of force against its neighbours,  
Recognizing that any hostile or provocative action directed against its neighbours by the Government of Iraq constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region,  
Welcoming all diplomatic and other efforts to resolve the crisis,  
Determined to prevent Iraq from resorting to threats and intimidation of its neighbours and the United Nations,  
Underlining that it will consider Iraq fully responsible for the serious consequences of any failure to fulfil the demands in the present resolution,  
Noting that Iraq has affirmed its readiness to resolve in a positive manner the issue of recognizing Kuwait's sovereignty and its borders as endorsed by resolution 833 (1993) , but underlining that Iraq must unequivocally commit itself by full and formal constitutional procedures to respect Kuwait's sovereignty, territorial integrity and borders, as required by resolutions 687 (1991) and 833 (1993) ,  
Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Kuwait and Iraq,  
Reaffirming its statement of 8 October 1994 (S/1994/PRST/58), Taking note of the letter from the Permanent Representative of Kuwait of 6 October 1994 (S/1994/1137), regarding the statement by the Revolutionary Command Council of Iraq of 6 October 1994,  
Taking note also of the letter from the Permanent Representative of Iraq of 10 October 1994 (S/1994/1149), announcing that the Government of Iraq had decided to withdraw the troops recently deployed in the direction of the border with Kuwait,  
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Condemns recent military deployments by Iraq in the direction of the border with Kuwait;  
2.       Demands that Iraq immediately complete the withdrawal of all military units recently deployed to southern Iraq to their original positions;  
3.       Demands that Iraq not again utilize its military or any other forces in a hostile or provocative manner to threaten either its neighbours or United Nations operations in Iraq;  
4.       Demands therefore that Iraq not redeploy to the south the units referred to in paragraph 2 above or take any other action to enhance its military capacity in southern Iraq;  
5.       Demands that Iraq cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Commission;  
6.       Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
