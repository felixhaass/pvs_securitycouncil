Resolution 1495 (2003)

The Security Council,
Recalling all its resolutions on the question of Western Sahara, and reaffirming, in particular, resolution 1429 (2002) of 30 July 2002,
Stressing that in view of lack of progress in the settlement of the dispute over Western Sahara a political solution is critically needed,
Concerned that this lack of progress continues to cause suffering to the people of Western Sahara, remains a source of potential instability in the region and obstructs the economic development of the Maghreb region,
Reaffirming its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements consistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and noting the role and responsibilities of the parties in this respect,
Commending the parties for their continuing commitment to the ceasefire and welcoming the essential contribution which the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is making in that regard,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 23 May 2003 (S/2003/565) and the Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara presented by his Personal Envoy, as well as the responses of the parties and the neighbouring States,
Acting under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Continues to support strongly the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy and similarly supports their Peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara as an optimum political solution on the basis of agreement between the two parties;
2. Calls upon the parties to work with the United Nations and with each other towards acceptance and implementation of the Peace plan;

5. Reiterates its call upon the parties to collaborate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the implementation of confidencebuilding measures and continues to urge the international community to provide generous support to UNHCR and the World Food Programme in order to help them overcome the deteriorating food situation among the refugees;
