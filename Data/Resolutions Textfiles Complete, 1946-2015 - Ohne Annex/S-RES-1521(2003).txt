Distr.: General 22 December 2003

Resolution 1521 (2003)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4890th meeting, on 22 December 2003
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and West Africa,
Taking note of the reports of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia dated 7 August 2003 (S/2003/779) and 28 October 2003 (S/2003/937 and S/2003/937/Add.1) submitted pursuant to resolution 1478 (2003),
Expressing serious concern at the findings of the Panel of Experts that the measures imposed by resolution 1343 (2001) continue to be breached, particularly through the acquisition of arms,
Welcoming the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the former Government of Liberia, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) on 18 August 2003 in Accra, and that the National Transitional Government of Liberia under Chairman Gyude Bryant took office on 14 October 2003,
Calling upon all States in the region, particularly the National Transitional Government of Liberia, to work together to build lasting regional peace, including through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the International Contact Group on Liberia, the Mano River Union and the Rabat Process,
Noting with concern, however, that the ceasefire and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement are not yet being universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that much of the country remains outside the authority of the National Transitional Government of Liberia, particularly those areas to which the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has not yet deployed,
Recognizing the linkage between the illegal exploitation of natural resources such as diamonds and timber, illicit trade in such resources, and the proliferation and trafficking of illegal arms as a major source of fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in West Africa, particularly in Liberia,
Determining that the situation in Liberia and the proliferation of arms and armed non-State actors, including mercenaries, in the subregion continue to

S/RES/1521 (2003)
constitute a threat to international peace and security in West Africa, in particular to the peace process in Liberia,
