The Security Council,

Recalling also its resolution 788 (1992) of 19 November 1992, in which it decided, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, that all States shall, for the purpose of establishing peace and stability in Liberia, immediately implement a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia until the Security Council decides otherwise, and in which it decided also that the embargo shall not apply to weapons and military equipment destined for the sole use of the peace-keeping forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia, subject to any review that may be required in conformity with the report of the Secretary-General,
Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General dated 24 February 1995 (S/1995/158) and 10 April 1995 (S/1995/279) on the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL),
Deeply concerned that the cease-fire in Liberia has broken down, precluding the full deployment of UNOMIL and preventing UNOMIL from fully carrying out its mandate,
Noting with deep concern that in violation of resolution 788 (1992) arms continue to be imported into Liberia, exacerbating the conflict,
Welcoming the decision of ECOWAS to hold a summit of Heads of State in May 1995,
1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNOMIL until 30 June 1995;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by 15 June 1995 on the situation in Liberia, including whether there is an effective cease-fire and whether UNOMIL can carry out its mandate, and on the status of contributions of financial and logistical resources from the international community in support of the troops participating in ECOMOG, and notes that the Council will consider the future of UNOMIL in the light of the Secretary-General's report;
