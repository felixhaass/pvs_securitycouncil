The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 872 (1993) of 5 October 1993 establishing the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), as well as its resolution 893 (1994) of 6 January 1994,  
Recalling its resolutions 812 (1993) of 12 March 1993, 846 (1993) of 22 June 1993 and 891 (1993) of 20 December 1993,  
Recalling also its statement dated 17 February 1994 (S/PRST/1994/8),  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 30 March 1994 (S/1994/360),  
Welcoming the valuable contribution to peace being made in Rwanda by UNAMIR,  
Expressing its deep concern at the delay in the establishment of the broad-based transitional Government and the Transitional National Assembly,  
Emphasizing that the Security Council in resolution 893 (1994) of 6 January 1994, authorized the deployment of a second battalion to the demilitarized zone as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report of 30 December 1993 (S/26927), and that the international community has thus done its part in ensuring that conditions exist for implementing the Agreement,  
Considering that the fact that the transitional institutions have not been established constitutes a major obstacle to the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement,  
Concerned at the deterioration in security in the country, particularly in Kigali,  
Concerned also at the deterioration of the humanitarian and health situation,  
1.       Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on Rwanda dated 30 March 1994;  
2.       Decides to extend the mandate of UNAMIR until 29 July 1994, on the understanding that the Security Council will, within the next six weeks, review the situation in Rwanda, including the role played in that country by the United Nations, if the Secretary-General informs it in a report that the transitional institutions provided for under the Arusha Peace Agreement have not been established and that insufficient progress has been made for the implementation of phase II of the Secretary-General's plan contained in his report of 24 September 1993 (S/26488);  
3.       Regrets the delay in the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement, and urges the parties to resolve their latest differences without delay with a view to the immediate establishment of those transitional institutions still required for the continuation of the process, and particularly the implementation of phase II;  
4.       Welcomes the fact that, despite the difficulties encountered in implementing the Arusha Peace Agreement, the cease-fire has been respected, and commends in this respect the essential contribution made by UNAMIR;  
5.       Recalls nevertheless that continued support for UNAMIR, including the provision of an additional 45 civilian police monitors as described in paragraph 38 of the Secretary-General's report, will depend upon full and prompt implementation by the parties of the Arusha Peace Agreement;  
6.       Welcomes the continued efforts by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to help promote and facilitate dialogue between all parties concerned;  
7.       Commends the efforts of Member States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations which have provided humanitarian and other assistance, encourages them to continue and increase such assistance, and again urges others to provide such assistance;  
8.       Commends in particular the efforts of the Organization of African Unity and its agencies, as well as those of the Tanzanian Facilitator, in providing diplomatic, political, humanitarian and other support for the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Council;  
9.       Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the size and cost of UNAMIR to seek economies;  
10.     Decides to remain actively seized of the question.
