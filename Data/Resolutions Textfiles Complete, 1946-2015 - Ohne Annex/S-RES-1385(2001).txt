Affirming the commitment of all States to respect the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Sierra Leone,
Welcoming the significant progress made in the peace process in Sierra Leone, including in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, and the efforts of the Government to extend its authority over the diamond-producing areas, with the assistance of UNAMSIL, but noting that it has not yet established effective authority over those areas,
Expressing its continued concern at the role played by the illicit trade in diamonds in the conflict in Sierra Leone,
Welcoming General Assembly resolution A/RES/55/56 of 1 December 2000, as well as ongoing efforts by interested States, the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, and non-governmental organizations to break the link between illicit trade in rough diamonds and armed conflict, particularly through the significant progress made by the Kimberley Process, and encouraging further progress in this regard,
Welcoming the establishment of a certification regime in relation to Guinea's exports of rough diamonds and the continued efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as well as West African countries towards developing a region-wide certification regime,
Emphasizing the responsibility of all member States, including diamond importing countries, for fully implementing the measures in resolution 1306 (2000),

S/RES/1385 (2001)
Determining that the situation in Sierra Leone continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 1. Welcomes the establishment and implementation of the Certificate of Origin regime for trade in diamonds in Sierra Leone, and the export of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone certified under that regime; 2.

Decides that the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1306 (2000) shall remain in force for a new period of 11 months from 5 January 2002, except that, pursuant to paragraph 5 of resolution 1306 (2000), rough diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone under the Certificate of Origin regime shall continue to be exempt from these measures, and affirms that, in addition to its six-monthly review in accordance with paragraph 15 of resolution 1306 (2000), at the end of this period it will review the situation in Sierra Leone, including the extent of the government's authority over the diamond-producing areas, in order to decide whether to extend these measures for a further period and, if necessary, to modify them or adopt further measures; 4. Decides also that the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1306 (2000) as extended by paragraph 3 above, shall be terminated immediately if the Council determines that it would be appropriate to do so; 5.
