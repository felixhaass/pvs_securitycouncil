The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992 and all relevant resolutions,  
Recalling further the statement of the President of the Security Council of 25 August 1994 (S/PRST/1994/46),  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 17 September 1994 (S/1994/1068),  
Deeply concerned by the deteriorating security environment, strongly condemning the attacks and harassment against UNOSOM II and other international personnel serving in Somalia and underlining the responsibility of the Somali parties for the security and safety of these personnel,  
Reaffirming that the people of Somalia bear the ultimate responsibility for achieving national reconciliation and for rebuilding their country,  
Stressing that the nature and the duration of the international support and resources the international community is committing to Somalia, including the continuing presence of UNOSOM II, depend very much on the resolve of the Somali parties to achieve political compromise,  
Urging, in this context, the Somali parties to redouble their efforts to advance the process of national reconciliation in Somalia,  
Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to submit to the Council by mid-October his assessment of the prospects of national reconciliation and recommendations for the future of the United Nations operation in Somalia,  
1.       Decides to extend the mandate of UNOSOM II for a period of one month expiring 31 October 1994, prior to which the Council will undertake a thorough examination of UNOSOM's mandate with a view to deciding on its future;  
2.       Encourages the Secretary-General to continue with and intensify preparations of contingency arrangements for the implementation of possible decisions, including withdrawal of UNOSOM II within a specified time-frame, which the Council may take;  
3.       Declares its readiness to consider sending a mission of the Council to Somalia at the appropriate time in order to convey directly to the Somali political parties the views of the Council on the situation in Somalia and on the future of the United Nations presence there;  
4.       Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
