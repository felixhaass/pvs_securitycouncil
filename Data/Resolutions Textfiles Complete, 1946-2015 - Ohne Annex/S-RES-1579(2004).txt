Distr.: General 21 December 2004

Resolution 1579 (2004)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5105th meeting, on 21 December 2004
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and West Africa,
Taking note of the reports of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia dated 24 September 2004 (S/2004/752) and 6 December 2004 (S/2004/955) submitted pursuant to resolution 1549 (2004),
Taking note of the letter from the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral in Liberia of 13 December 2004 to the Chairman of the Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003),
Recognizing the linkage between the illegal exploitation of natural resources such as diamonds and timber, illicit trade in such resources, and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as one of the sources of fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in West Africa, particularly in Liberia,
Recalling that the measures imposed under resolution 1521 (2003) were designed to prevent such illegal exploitation from fuelling a resumption of the conflict in Liberia, as well as to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the extension of the authority of the National Transitional Government throughout Liberia,
Expressing its satisfaction that the full deployment of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has contributed to the improvement of security throughout Liberia, whilst recognizing that the National Transitional Government has not yet established its authority throughout Liberia,
Expressing concern that former President Charles Taylor and others still closely associated with him continue to engage in activities that undermine peace and stability in Liberia and the region,
Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards achieving the objectives set forth in paragraphs 5, 7 and 11 of resolution 1521 (2003),

S/RES/1579 (2004)
Welcoming the steps taken by the National Transitional Government of Liberia towards meeting the conditions established by the Security Council for lifting the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003),
Noting the completion of demobilization and disarmament, respect for the ceasefire and implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, but emphasizing that significant challenges remain in completing reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector, as well as establishing and maintaining stability in Liberia and the subregion,
Noting with concern that, despite having initiated important reforms, the National Transitional Government of Liberia has made only limited progress towards establishing its full authority and control over the timber-producing areas and towards ensuring that government revenues from the Liberian timber industry are not used to fuel conflict or otherwise in violation of the Council's resolutions but are used for legitimate purposes for the benefit of the Liberian people, including development,
Welcoming the start of preparations by the National Transitional Government of Liberia to establish an effective Certificate of Origin regime for trade in rough diamonds that is transparent and internationally verifiable, looking forward to the visit by representatives of the Kimberley Process to Liberia in early 2005, encouraging the Government to continue its preparations in that regard and urging States to increase their support for its efforts,
Determining that the situation in Liberia continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Decides, on the basis of its assessments above of progress made by the National Transitional Government of Liberia towards meeting the conditions for lifting the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003):

2. Reiterates the Council's readiness to terminate these measures once the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above have been met;

Initiative and the necessary reforms in the Forestry Development Authority, and urges all members of the National Transitional Government to commit themselves to this end for the benefit of the Liberian people;
4. Notes that the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) remain in force to prevent former President Charles Taylor, his immediate family members, senior officials of the former Taylor regime, or other close allies or associates from using misappropriated funds and property to interfere in the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia and the subregion, and reconfirms its intention to review these measures at least once a year;
5. Reiterates its call on the international donor community to continue to provide assistance to the peace process, including for reintegration and reconstruction, to contribute generously to consolidated humanitarian appeals, to disburse as soon as possible the pledges made at the Liberia Reconstruction Conference held in New York on 5-6 February 2004 and to respond to the immediate financial, administrative and technical needs of the National Transitional Government of Liberia, in particular to assist the Government to meet the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above, so that the measures can be lifted as soon as possible;
6. Restates its demand that all States refrain from any action that might contribute to further destabilization of the situation in the subregion and further demands that all West African States take action to prevent armed individuals and groups from using their territory to prepare and commit attacks on neighbouring countries;
7. Reminds all States of their obligation to implement all the measures under resolutions 1521 (2003) and 1532 (2004) and particularly urges the National Transitional Government of Liberia to implement without delay its obligations under paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) to freeze the assets of all persons designated by the Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003) ("the Committee");
8. Decides to re-establish the Panel of Experts appointed pursuant to resolution 1549 (2004) for a further period until 21 June 2005 to undertake the following tasks:
(a) to conduct a follow-up assessment mission to Liberia and neighbouring States, in order to investigate and compile a report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures referred to in paragraph 1 above, including any information relevant to the designation by the Committee of the individuals described in paragraph 4 (a) of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004), and including the various sources of financing, such as from natural resources, for the illicit trade of arms;
