The Security Council,  
Recalling its resolution 910 (1994) of 14 April 1994,  
Welcoming the signing on 4 April 1994 at Surt (Libya), by the representatives of the Republic of Chad on the one hand and of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on the other hand, of the agreement relating to the implementation of the Judgment of the International Court of Justice of 3 February 1994,  
Taking note of the letter dated 6 April 1994 from the Permanent Representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General (S/1994/402) and the letter dated 13 April 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Chad to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General (S/1994/424), and the annexes thereto,  
Noting that the agreement signed at Surt (Libya) provides that United Nations observers shall be present during all the Libyan withdrawal operations and shall establish that the withdrawal is actually effected,  
Determined to assist the parties in implementing the Judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning their territorial dispute and thereby to help promote peaceful relations between them, in keeping with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,  
Having examined the report of the Secretary-General dated 27 April 1994 (S/1994/512),
