1. Decides to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 31 March 1999 to allow for consultations in the hope and expectation of agreement on the protocols on identification, appeals and repatriation planning activities, as well as on the essential issue of the implementation calendar, without undermining the integrity of the Secretary-General's proposed package or calling into question its main elements, for the prompt resumption of voter identification and initiation of the appeals process;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council by 22 March 1999 on the implementation of this resolution;
4. Supports the intention of the Secretary-General to ask his Personal Envoy to reassess the viability of the mandate of MINURSO should the prospects for putting the package of measures into effect remain elusive at the time of submission of the Secretary-General's next report;
5. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
