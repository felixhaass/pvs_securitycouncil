Deploring the continued obstacles that have been imposed by the Government of Sudan on the work of the Panel of Experts during the course of its mandate, including delays in the issuance of visas, restrictions to the freedom of movement of the Panel of Experts and UNAMID, and limitations on the Panel of Experts' access to areas of armed conflict and reported violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, while noting the improved interaction between the Focal Point of the Government of Sudan and the Panel of Experts,

particular vulnerable groups such as women and children, and from violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and the need to address the urgent humanitarian crisis faced by the people of Darfur, including the guarantee of safe, timely and unrestricted humanitarian access to all areas by humanitarian agencies and personnel,
Noting that acts of hostility, violence or intimidation against the civilian population, including IDPs, in Darfur and other activities that could endanger or undermine the Parties' commitment to a complete and durable cessation of hostilities would be inconsistent with the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur,
