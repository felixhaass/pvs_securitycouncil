Resolution 1533 (2004)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4926th meeting, on 12 March 2004
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements by its President concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Reiterating its concern regarding the presence of armed groups and militias in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in North and South Kivu and in Ituri, which perpetuate a climate of insecurity in the whole region,
Condemning the continuing illicit flow of weapons into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and declaring its determination to closely monitor compliance with the arms embargo imposed by its resolution 1493 of 28 July 2003,
Underscoring the right of the Congolese people to control their own natural resources, recalling in this regard the statement made by its President on 19 November 2003 (S/PRST/2003/21), which emphasizes the connection, in the context of the continuing conflict, between the illegal exploitation of natural resources and trafficking in raw materials and arms, as highlighted in the final report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (S/2003/1027), and stressing for this purpose, the need for all Member States to work to achieve an end to the illegal exploitation of natural resources,
Encouraging all States signatories to the Nairobi Declaration of 15 March 2000 on the Problem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in the Great Lakes Region and Horn of Africa to implement quickly the measures required by the Co-ordinated Agenda for Action as an important means of support of the measures imposed by paragraph 20 of resolution 1493,
Taking note of the Secretary-General's fourteenth report on the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), dated 17 November 2003 (S/2003/1098), and of its recommendations,
Noting that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
