Adopted by the Security Council at its 6243rd meeting, on 16 December 2009
The Security Council,
Taking note of the letters to the President of the Council from the SecretaryGeneral dated 2 November 2009 (S/2009/571) and 23 November 2009 (S/2009/601), attaching letters from the President of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ("the International Tribunal") dated 15 October 2009 and 6 November 2009, respectively,
Recalling its resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994, 1165 (1998) of 30 April 1998, 1329 (2000) of 30 November 2000, 1411 (2002) of 17 May 2002, 1431 (2002) of 14 August 2002, 1717 (2006) of 13 October 2006, 1824 (2008) of 18 July 2008, 1855 (2008) of 19 December 2008, and 1878 (2009) of 7 July 2009,
Recalling in particular its resolutions 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 and 1534 (2004) of 26 March 2004, in which the Security Council calls on the International Tribunal to take all possible measures to complete investigations by the end of 2004, to complete all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008, and to complete all work in 2010,
Taking note of the assessment by the International Tribunal in its Completion Strategy Report (S/2009/587) that the Tribunal will not be in a position to complete all its work in 2010,
Recalling that in resolution 1878 (2009) the Security Council extended the term of office of permanent judges and ad litem judges, who are members of the Trial Chambers, until 31 December 2010, or until the completion of the cases to which they are assigned, if sooner; and decided to review the extension of the term of office of the permanent judges at the International Tribunal, who are members of the Appeals Chamber, by 31 December 2009, in light of the progress of the International Tribunal in the implementation of its Completion Strategy,
Convinced of the advisability of extending the authorization granted to the Secretary-General in resolution 1855 (2008) to appoint additional ad litem judges to the nine ad litem judges authorized by the Statute of the International Tribunal, as a temporary measure to enable the International Tribunal to complete trials and conduct additional trials as soon as possible in order to meet the goals of the Completion Strategy,
