Adopted by the Security Council at its 5742nd meeting, on 14 September 2007
The Security Council,
Recalling its resolution 1504 (2003) of 4 September 2003,
Having regard to Article 16 (4) of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
Aware that the term of office for Ms. Carla Del Ponte as Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia expires on 14 September 2007,

Noting the intention of the Secretary-General to submit the name of his nominee for the position of Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
Decides, notwithstanding the provisions of article 16 (4) of the Statute, to extend for a final period the appointment of Ms. Carla Del Ponte as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia with effect from 15 September 2007 until 31 December 2007.
