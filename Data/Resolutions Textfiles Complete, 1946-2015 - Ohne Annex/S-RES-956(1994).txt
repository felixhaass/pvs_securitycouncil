The Security Council,  
Recalling Chapter XII of the Charter of the United Nations which established an international trusteeship system,  
Conscious of its responsibility relating to strategic areas as set forth in Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Charter,  
Recalling its resolution 21 (1947) of 2 April 1947 by which it approved the Trusteeship Agreement for the former Japanese Mandated Islands, since known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, [1]  
Noting that the Trusteeship Agreement designated the United States of America as Administering Authority of the Trust Territory,  
Mindful that article 6 of the Trusteeship Agreement, in conformity with Article 76 of the Charter, obligated the Administering Authority, inter alia, to promote the development of the inhabitants of the Trust Territory towards self- government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust Territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned,  
Aware that, towards this end, negotiations between the Administering Authority and representatives of the Trust Territory began in 1969 and resulted in the conclusion of a Compact of Free Association in the case of Palau,  
Satisfied that the people of Palau have freely exercised their right to self-determination in approving the new status agreement in a plebiscite observed by a visiting mission of the Trusteeship Council and that, in addition to this plebiscite, the duly constituted legislature of Palau has adopted a resolution approving the new status agreement, [2] thereby freely expressing their wish to terminate the status of Palau as a Trust Territory,  
Taking note of resolution 2199 (LXI) of the Trusteeship Council of 25 May 1994,  
Determines, in the light of the entry into force on 1 October 1994 of the new status agreement for Palau, that the objectives of the Trusteeship Agreement have been fully attained, and that the applicability of the Trusteeship Agreement has terminated with respect to Palau.
