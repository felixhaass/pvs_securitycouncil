The Security Council,  
Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions on the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in particular its resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993),  
Reaffirming the need for a lasting peace settlement to be signed by all the Bosnian parties, and implemented in good faith by them, and condemning the decision by the Bosnian Serb party to refuse to accept the proposed territorial settlement (S/1994/1081),  
Reaffirming also the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,  
Expressing special concern about the escalation in recent fighting in the Bihac pocket, including those in, from and around the safe areas, and the flow of refugees and displaced persons resulting from it,  
Bearing in mind the importance of facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes,  
Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General of 10 March 1994 (S/1994/291) and 16 March 1994 (S/1994/300) and of his recommendations concerning the definition and implementation of the concept of safe areas in his report of 9 May 1994 (S/1994/555),  
Recalling the statements by the President of the Security Council of 6 April 1994 (S/PRST/1994/14), 30 June 1994 (S/PRST/1994/31), 13 November 1994 (S/PRST/1994/66) and 18 November 1994 (S/PRST/1994/69),  
Reaffirming its previous calls on all parties and others concerned to refrain from any hostile action that could cause further escalation in the fighting, and to achieve urgently a cease-fire in the Bihac area,  
Reiterating the importance of maintaining Sarajevo, the capital of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a united city and a multicultural, multi-ethnic and pluri-religious centre, and noting in this context the positive contribution that agreement between the parties on the demilitarization of Sarajevo could make to this end, to the restoration of normal life in Sarajevo, and to achieving an overall settlement, consistent with the Contact Group peace plan,  
Taking note of the communiqué on Bosnia and Herzegovina issued on 30 July 1994 by the Troika of the European Union and the Foreign Ministers of the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America (S/1994/916) and, in particular, of their commitment to strengthen the regime of safe areas,  
1.       Expresses its grave concern over the recent hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina;  
2.       Condemns any violation of the international border between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and demands that all parties and others concerned, and in particular the so-called Krajina Serb forces, fully respect the border and refrain from hostile acts across it;  
3.       Expresses its full support for the efforts by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), to ensure implementation of the Security Council resolutions on safe areas;  
4.       Calls upon all the Bosnian parties to respect fully the status and functions of UNPROFOR and to cooperate with it in its efforts to ensure implementation of the Security Council resolutions on safe areas and demands that all parties and others concerned show maximum restraint and put an end to all hostile actions in and around the safe areas in order to ensure that UNPROFOR can carry out its mandate in this regard effectively and safely;  
5.       Requests the Secretary-General to update his recommendations on modalities of the implementation of the concept of safe areas and to encourage UNPROFOR, in cooperation with the Bosnian parties, to continue their efforts to achieve agreements on strengthening the regimes of safe areas taking into account the specific situation in each case, and recalls its request to the Secretary-General in the statement by the President of the Security Council of 13 November 1994 to report as soon as possible on any further measures to stabilize the situation in and around the safe area of Bihac;  
6.       Further requests the Secretary-General and UNPROFOR to intensify efforts aimed at reaching agreement with the Bosnian parties on the modalities of demilitarization of Sarajevo, bearing in mind the need for the restoration of normal life to the city and for free access to and from the city by land and air and the free and unimpeded movement of people, goods and services in and around the city in line with its resolution 900 (1994), particularly operative paragraph 2;  
7.       Requests the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the present resolution by 1 December 1994;
