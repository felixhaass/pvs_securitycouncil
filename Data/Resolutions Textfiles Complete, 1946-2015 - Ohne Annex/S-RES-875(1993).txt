Noting resolutions MRE/RES.1/91, MRE/RES.2/91, MRE/RES.3/92 and MRE/RES.4/92 adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States, and resolution CP/RES.594 (923/92) and declarations CP/Dec.8 (927/93), CP/Dec.9 (931/93), CP/Dec.10 (934/93) and CP/Dec.15 (967/93), adopted by the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States,  
Deeply disturbed by the continuing obstruction to the dispatch of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), pursuant to resolution 867 (1993) , and the failure of the Armed Forces of Haiti to carry out their responsibilities to allow the Mission to begin its work,  
Condemning the assassination of officials of the legitimate Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  
Taking note of the letter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the Secretary-General of 15 October 1993 (S/26587), in which he requested the Council to call on Member States to take the necessary measures to strengthen the provisions of Security Council resolution 873 (1993) ,  
Mindful of the report of the Secretary-General of 13 October 1993 (S/26573) informing the Council that the military authorities of Haiti, including the police, have not complied in full with the Governors Island Agreement,  
Reaffirming its determination that, in these unique and exceptional circumstances, the failure of military authorities in Haiti to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region,  
Acting under Chapters VII and VIII of the Charter of the United Nations,  
1.       Calls upon Member States, acting nationally or through regional agencies or arrangements, cooperating with the legitimate Government of Haiti, to use such measures commensurate with the specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of the Secretary-General to ensure strict implementation of the provisions of resolutions 841 (1993) and 873 (1993) relating to the supply of petroleum or petroleum products or arms and related materiel of all types, and in particular to halt inward maritime shipping as necessary in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations;  
2.       Confirms that it is prepared to consider further necessary measures to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions;  
3.       Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
