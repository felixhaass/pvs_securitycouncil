Adopted by the Security Council at its 7101st meeting, on 27 January 2014
The Security Council,
Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed and further reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts,
Recalling all its relevant resolutions and Presidential Statements concerning threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts,
Reiterating the obligation of Member States to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts,
Recalling relevant international counter-terrorism instruments, including the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages,
Strongly condemning incidents of kidnapping and hostage-taking committed by terrorist groups for any purpose, including raising funds or gaining political concessions,
Expressing concern at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostagetaking committed by terrorist groups with the aim of raising funds, or gaining political concessions, in particular the increase in kidnappings by Al-Qaida and its affiliated groups, and underscoring that the payment of ransoms to terrorists funds future kidnappings and hostage-takings which creates more victims and perpetuates the problem,

Expressing its commitment to support efforts to reduce terrorist groups' access to funding and financial services through the ongoing work of United Nations counter-terrorism bodies and the Financial Action Task Force to improve anti-money laundering and terrorist financing frameworks worldwide,
Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters of new information and communication technologies, in particular the Internet, for the purposes of recruitment and incitement to commit terrorist acts, as well as for the financing, planning and preparation of their activities,
Recalling its resolutions 1904 (2009), 1989 (2011) and 2083 (2012), which, inter alia, confirm that the requirements of operative paragraph 1 (a) of these resolutions, also apply to the payment of ransoms to individuals, groups, undertakings or entities on the Al-Qaida sanctions list,

1.
