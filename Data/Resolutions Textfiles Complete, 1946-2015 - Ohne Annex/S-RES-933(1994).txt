Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General of 20 June 1994 (S/1994/742) and 28 June 1994 (S/1994/765),  
Noting resolution MRE/RES.6/94, adopted unanimously by the ad hoc meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States on 9 June 1994, which, inter alia, calls for a strengthening of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH),  
Recalling the terms of the Governors Island Agreement (S/26063) and the related Pact of New York (S/26297),

Welcoming the measures taken by Member States at the national level aimed at further strengthening the impact of sanctions,  
Noting the importance of the rapid dispatch of UNMIH as soon as conditions permit,  
Condemning the recent escalation of violations of international humanitarian law and the naming of the so-called de facto III government,  
Deeply concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Haiti, and stressing the need for increased assistance from the international community to meet the humanitarian needs of the Haitian people,

4.       Authorizes the Secretary-General to identify personnel, plan and make prior arrangements to enable the Security Council to authorize the rapid deployment of UNMIH, once the Secretary-General reports to the Council and the proper environment for such a deployment has been created;
