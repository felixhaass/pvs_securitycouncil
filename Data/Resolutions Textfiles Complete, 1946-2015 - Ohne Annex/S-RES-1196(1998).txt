Recalling the statement of its President made on 25 September 1997 (S/PRST/1997/46) at the meeting of the Council at the level of Foreign Ministers on the situation in Africa,
Having considered the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 13 April 1998 on "The causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa", which was submitted to the General Assembly (A/52/871) and to the Security Council (S/1998/318) in accordance with the above-mentioned statement, regarding the importance of strengthening the effectiveness of arms embargoes as a means to diminish the availability of arms with which to pursue armed conflicts,
Stressing the principles of the political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States,
Mindful of the Cairo Declaration of 1993 (A/48/322, annex II), which stipulated that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution would have as a primary objective the anticipation and prevention of conflicts,
Reaffirming the obligations of all Member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means and stressing the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,
Recognizing that the International Commission of Inquiry established by its resolution 1013 (1995) of 7 September 1995 and reactivated in accordance with its resolution 1161 (1998) of 9 April 1998 is an example of a useful means for strengthening the effectiveness of an arms embargo established by the Council,
