The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and the statements of its President concerning the situation in Sierra Leone,
Recognizing the continuing fragile security situation in the Mano River region, particularly the conflict in Liberia and the need to strengthen further the capacity of the Sierra Leone police and armed forces to enable them to maintain security and stability independently,
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 23 June 2003 (S/2003/663), particularly the options for drawdown of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) described in paragraphs 32 to 40,
1. Approves the recommendation of the Secretary-General, in paragraph 68 of his report, that the drawdown of UNAMSIL should proceed according to the "modified status quo" option towards withdrawal by December 2004, and welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to submit additional recommendations to the Council in early 2004 concerning a residual presence of the United Nations;
2. Decides to monitor closely the key benchmarks for drawdown and requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council at the end of each phase, and at regular intervals, on the progress made with respect to the benchmarks, and to make any necessary recommendations on the planning of subsequent phases of the withdrawal;
3. Requests the Secretary-General to proceed accordingly;
4. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
