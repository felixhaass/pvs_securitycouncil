Distr.: General 8 April 2003

Resolution 1474 (2003)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4737th meeting, on 8 April 2003
The Security Council,
Reaffirming its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992, which established an embargo on all delivery of weapons and military equipment to Somalia (hereinafter referred to as the "arms embargo"), resolution 1407 (2002) of 3 May 2002, resolution 1425 (2002) of 22 July 2002, and the statements of its President of 28 March 2002 (S/PRST/2002/8), of 12 December 2002 (S/PRST/2002/35), and of 12 March 2003 (S/PRST/2003/2),
Noting with regret that the arms embargo has been continuously violated since 1992, including since the signing of the "Declaration on Cessation of Hostilities and the Structure and Principles of the Somalia National Reconciliation Process" (Eldoret Declaration) in October 2002, and expressing concern over the illegal activities linked to the financing of arms purchases and military activities by the violators of the arms embargo in Somalia,
Reiterating its firm support for the Somali National Reconciliation Process and the ongoing Somali National Reconciliation Conference, reaffirming the importance of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter, and commending the efforts of Kenya as the host of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) sponsored Somali National Reconciliation Conference,
Reiterating its insistence that all States, in particular those of the region, should not interfere in the internal affairs of Somalia. Such interference only further destabilizes Somalia, contributes to a climate of fear and impacts adversely on human rights, and could jeopardize the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia. Stressing that the territory of Somalia should not be used to undermine stability in the subregion,
Reiterating its serious concern over the continued flow of weapons and ammunition supplies to and through Somalia from sources outside the country, in contravention of the arms embargo, which is severely undermining peace and security and the political efforts for national reconciliation in Somalia, and which
