2. Commends the progress in identifying potential voters since the beginning of the year;

3. Expresses concern, however, that certain practices identified in the Secretary-General's report are hampering further progress towards the implementation of the Settlement Plan and underlines the need for the parties to heed the Secretary-General's call on them to work with the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) in a spirit of genuine cooperation;

4. Decides in this context, and with a view to accelerating the implementation of the Settlement Plan, to send a mission of the Council to the region;

6. Decides to consider the further extension of the mandate of MINURSO beyond 30 June 1995 in the light of the Secretary-General's report of 19 May 1995 and the report of the Security Council mission referred to in paragraph 4 above;

7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
