Noting also the observation contained in the report of the SecretaryGeneral of 1 July 1997 that the presence of the United Nations military observers continues to be essential to maintain conditions that are conducive to a negotiated settlement of the disputed issue of Prevlaka,
Determining that the situation in Croatia continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security,
1. Authorizes the United Nations military observers to continue monitoring the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, in accordance with resolutions 779 (1992) and 981 (1995) and paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report of the Secretary-General of 13 December 1995 (S/1995/1028*) until 15 January 1998;
