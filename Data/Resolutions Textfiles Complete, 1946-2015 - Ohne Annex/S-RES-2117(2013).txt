Adopted by the Security Council at its 7036th meeting, on 26 September 2013
The Security Council,
Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security, and noting the significance of small arms and light weapons as the most frequently used weapons in the majority of recent armed conflicts,
Recalling the statements of its President of 19 March 2010 (S/PRST/2010/6), of 14 January 2009 (S/PRST/2009/1), of 29 June 2007 (S/PRST/2007/24), of 17 February 2005 (S/PRST/2005/7), of 19 January 2004 (S/PRST/2004/1), of 31 October 2002 (S/PRST/2002/30), of 31 August 2001 (S/PRST/2001/21) and of 24 September 1999 (S/PRST/1999/28), as well as other relevant resolutions of the Council, including that of 16 September 1998 (S/RES/1196 (1998)) and statements of its President related to small arms and light weapons,
Emphasizing that the right of individual and collective self-defence recognized in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and the legitimate security demands of all countries should be fully taken into account, and recognizing that small arms and light weapons are traded, manufactured and retained by States for legitimate security, sporting and commercial considerations,
Gravely concerned that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons in many regions of the world continue to pose threats to international peace and security, cause significant loss of life, contribute to instability and insecurity and continue to undermine the effectiveness of the Security Council in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,

States, international, regional and subregional organizations to tackle this scourge, and strongly encouraging support for such efforts,
Emphasizing the importance of assisting Member States as well as, intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations in capacity-building to prevent and address the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons,
Recalling with concern the close connection between international terrorism, transnational organized crime, drugs trafficking, money-laundering, other illicit financial transactions, illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons and arms trafficking, and the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources, illicit trade in such resources and the proliferation and trafficking of arms as a major factor fuelling and exacerbating many conflicts,

Recalling with grave concern that the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons fuel armed conflicts and have a wide range of negative human rights, humanitarian, development and socioeconomic consequences, in particular on the security of civilians in armed conflict, including the disproportionate impact on violence perpetrated against women and girls, and exacerbating sexual and gender-based violence and the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict in violation of applicable international law,
Noting that this resolution focuses on the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, including in respect of Council-mandated arms embargoes,
Acknowledging the important contribution of Council-mandated arms embargoes in countering the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, mitigating the intensity of conflict and creating conditions conducive to the peaceful resolution of situations that threaten or breach international peace and security, and acknowledging also the contribution Council-mandated arms embargoes make in supporting conflict prevention, post-conflict peacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform,
Recognizing the value of effective physical security and management of stockpiles of small arms, light weapons and ammunition as an important means to prevent the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, in accordance with global and regional standards, including through the application of voluntary guidelines, such as the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines (IATG) developed under the UN SaferGuard programme, and the International Small Arms Control Standards (ISACS) in arms and ammunition stockpile management practices,

Underlining the responsibility of States to prevent threats posed by the illicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons to international peace and security, and the devastating impact on civilians in armed conflict,
Recognizing that the misuse of small arms and light weapons has resulted in grave crimes and reaffirming therefore the relevant provisions of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the protection of civilians in armed conflict, including paragraphs 138 and 139 thereof regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,

Acknowledging the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty, taking note of the signature and ratification of the Treaty by some States, and looking forward to the important contribution it can make to international and regional peace, security and stability, reducing human suffering and promoting cooperation,
Welcoming the increased cooperation between the United Nations and INTERPOL, including the 2009 Supplementary Agreement between INTERPOL and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as individual agreements between INTERPOL and Council Sanctions Committees, which provide better optional tools including, those for weapons identification and information sharing, for the United Nations and Member States to implement Council-mandated arms embargoes more effectively,
