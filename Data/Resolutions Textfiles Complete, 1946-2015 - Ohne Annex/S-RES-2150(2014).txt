Stressing that the fight against impunity and to ensure accountability for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes has been strengthened through the work on and prosecution of these crimes in the international criminal justice system, ad hoc and mixed tribunals as well as specialized chambers in national tribunals; and recognizing in this regard the contribution of the International Criminal Court, in accordance with the principle of complementarity to national criminal jurisdictions as set out in the Rome Statute, towards holding accountable those responsible for such crimes, and reiterating its call on the importance of State cooperation with these courts and tribunals in accordance with the States' respective obligations,
Recognizing the contribution made by the ICTR to the fight against impunity and the development of international criminal justice, especially in re lation to the crime of genocide,
Noting that the prosecution of persons responsible for genocide and other serious international crimes, through the national justice system, including the Gacaca Courts of Rwanda, and the ICTR, contributed to the process of national reconciliation and to the restoration and maintenance of peace in Rwanda,
Recalling that leaders and members of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), were among the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, during which Hutu and others who opposed the genocide were also killed, further recalling that the FDLR is a group under United Nations sanctions, operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and which has continued to promote and commit ethnically based and other killings in Rwanda and in the DRC, and stressing the importance of neutralizing this group, in line with the Security Council resolution 2098 (2013),
