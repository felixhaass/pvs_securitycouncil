The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and West Africa,
Welcoming the peaceful and orderly conduct of the recent elections in Liberia, an important step in Liberia's progress towards lasting peace and stability,
Welcoming the commitment of President-elect Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to rebuilding Liberia for the benefit of all Liberians, with the support of the international community,
Stressing the continuing importance of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in improving security throughout Liberia and helping the new Government establish its authority throughout the country, particularly in the diamond- and timber-producing areas, and border areas,
Taking note of the report of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia dated 25 November 2005 (S/2005/745),
Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress towards meeting the conditions set out in paragraphs 5, 7 and 11 of resolution 1521 (2003), and concluding that insufficient progress has been made towards that end,
Underlining its determination to support the new Government of Liberia in its efforts to meet those conditions, and encouraging donors to do likewise,
Determining that the situation in Liberia continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Decides, on the basis of its assessment of progress made to date towards meeting the conditions for lifting the measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003):
(a) To renew the measures on arms and travel imposed by paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) for a further period of 12 months from the date of adoption of this resolution;

6. Notes that the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) remain in force and reconfirms its intention to review these measures at least once a year;
7. Emphasizes its concern that the National Transitional Government of Liberia took no action to implement its obligations under paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004), and calls on the incoming Government to take such action immediately, particularly through adopting the necessary domestic legislation, with technical support provided by Member States;
8. Calls on the international donor community to support the incoming Government of Liberia by providing generous assistance to the peace process, including for reintegration of ex-combatants, reconstruction and humanitarian appeals, and by responding to the financial, administrative and technical needs of the Government of Liberia, in particular to assist the Government to meet the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 above, so that the measures can be lifted as soon as possible;
