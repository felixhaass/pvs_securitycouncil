Adopted by the Security Council at its 4023rd meeting, on 15 July 1999

The Security Council,
Recalling all its earlier relevant resolutions, in particular its resolutions 779 (1992) of 6 October 1992, 981 (1995) of 31 March 1995, 1147 (1998) of 13 January 1998, 1183 (1998) of 15 July 1998 and 1222 (1999) of 15 January 1999,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 July 1999 (S/1999/764) on the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP),
Recalling also the letters to its President, from the Chargé d'Affaires of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 18 June 1999 (S/1999/697) and from the Permanent Representative of Croatia of 25 June 1999 (S/1999/719), concerning the disputed issue of Prevlaka,
Reaffirming once again its commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders,

Reiterating its concern that longstanding violations of the demilitarization regime by both parties continue, including the standing presence of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia military personnel and the occasional presence of Croatian military elements in the demilitarized zone, and at limitations placed on the free movement of United Nations military observers by both parties,
Expressing its concern about more recent, additional violations of the demilitarized zone, in particular the presence there of troops of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,

Noting with satisfaction that the opening of crossing points between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Montenegro) in the demilitarized zones continue to facilitate civilian and commercial traffic in both directions without security incidents and continue to represent a significant confidencebuilding measure in the normalization of relations between the two parties, and urging the parties to utilize these openings as a basis for further confidencebuilding measures to achieve the normalization of relations between them,
Reiterating its serious concerns about the lack of substantive progress towards a settlement of the disputed issue of Prevlaka in the continuing bilateral negotiations between the parties pursuant to the Agreement on Normalization of Relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 23 August 1996 (S/1996/706, annex), and calling upon the parties to resume discussions,
Reiterating its call upon the parties urgently to put in place a comprehensive demining programme,
Commending the role played by UNMOP and noting also that the presence of the United Nations military observers continues to be essential to maintain conditions that are conducive to a negotiated settlement of the disputed issue of Prevlaka,
1. Authorizes the United Nations military observers to continue monitoring the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula, in accordance with resolutions 779 (1992) and 981 (1995) and paragraphs 19 and 20 of the report of the Secretary-General of 13 December 1995 (S/1995/1028*), until 15 January 2000;
2. Reiterates its calls upon the parties to cease all violations of the demilitarization regime in the United Nations designated zones, to take steps further to reduce tension and to improve safety and security in the area, to cooperate fully with the United Nations military observers and to ensure their safety and full and unrestricted freedom of movement;
3. Requests the Secretary-General to report by 15 October 1999 with recommendations and options further to develop confidence-building measures between the parties aimed, inter alia, at further facilitating freedom of movement of the civilian population;
4. Urges once again that the parties abide by their mutual commitments and implement fully the Agreement on Normalization of Relations, and stresses in particular the urgent need for them to fulfil rapidly and in good faith their commitment to reach a negotiated resolution of the disputed issue of Prevlaka in accordance with article 4 of the Agreement;
5. Requests the parties to continue to report at least bi-monthly to the Secretary-General on the status of their bilateral negotiations;
6. Requests the United Nations military observers and the multinational stabilization force authorized by the Council in resolution 1088 (1996) of 12 December 1996 and extended by resolution 1247 (1999) of 18 June 1999 to cooperate fully with each other;
7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
