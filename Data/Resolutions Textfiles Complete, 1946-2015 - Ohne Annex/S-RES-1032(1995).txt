Welcomes the humanitarian review undertaken by UNFICYP with regard to the living conditions of the Greek Cypriots and the Maronites living in the northern part of the island and of Turkish Cypriots living in the southern part of the island, supports UNFICYP's recommendations contained in the SecretaryGeneral's report (S/1995/1020 and Add.1), and decides to keep the matter under review;
5. Expresses concern about the continuing modernization and upgrading of military forces in the Republic of Cyprus and the lack of progress towards a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus, urges once again all concerned to commit themselves to such a reduction and to a reduction of defence spending in the Republic of Cyprus to help restore confidence between the parties and as a first step towards the withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces as described in the set of ideas (S/24472, annex) and calls upon the Secretary-General to promote efforts in this direction;
6. Expresses concern also about the failure by the military authorities on both sides to take reciprocal measures to prohibit along the cease-fire lines live ammunition or weapons other than those which are hand-held and to prohibit also the firing of weapons within sight or hearing of the buffer zone, and calls upon those authorities to enter into discussions with UNFICYP on this matter in line with paragraph 3 of resolution 839 (1993) of 11 June 1993;
7. Regrets the failure to reach agreement on the extension of the 1989 unmanning agreement to cover all areas of the buffer zone where the two sides are in close proximity to each other, and calls upon the military authorities on both sides to cooperate urgently with UNFICYP to this end;
8. Welcomes the initiative of UNFICYP in organizing successful bicommunal events, urges the leaders of both communities to promote tolerance, confidence and reconciliation between the two communities as recommended in the relevant reports of the Secretary-General, and calls upon them to promote further bicommunal contacts and to remove obstacles to such contacts;
9. Welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to continue contacts with the two leaders, to make every effort to find common ground for the basis for a resumption of direct talks;
