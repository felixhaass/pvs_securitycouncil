The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991 and all subsequent relevant resolutions,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 October 1994 (S/1994/1197),  
Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Angola,  
Reiterating the importance it attaches to the full implementation of the Acordos de Paz and relevant Security Council resolutions,  
Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the Force Commander and personnel of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II), the three observer States to the Angolan Peace Process, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and some neighbouring States in particular Zambia, and encouraging them to continue their efforts aimed at the earliest resolution of the Angolan crisis through negotiations within the framework of the Acordos de Paz and relevant Security Council resolutions,  
Encouraged by the substantial progress made recently in the Lusaka Peace Talks and reaffirming the importance of the parties showing flexibility and bringing them to a prompt and successful conclusion and achieving a comprehensive settlement,  
Declaring that renewed obstruction or procrastination in the peace process would be unacceptable,  
Deeply concerned, however, at continued military hostilities throughout the territory of Angola which cause extensive suffering to the civilian population and obstruct humanitarian relief efforts, and have delayed the successful conclusion of the Lusaka Peace Talks and hampered the effective implementation of the current mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission UNAVEM II,  
Reaffirming the obligation of all States to implement fully the provisions of paragraph 19 of resolution 864 (1993) ,  
Emphasizing that Angolans bear ultimate responsibility for the successful implementation of the "Acordos de Paz" and any subsequent agreement,  
1.       Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 October 1994;  
2.       Decides to extend the mandate of the UNAVEM II until 8 December 1994;  
3.       Calls upon the parties to honour the commitments already made by them at the talks in Lusaka and urges them to conclude immediately an agreement and thereafter to establish and respect fully an effective and sustainable ceasefire as a matter of urgency;  
4.       Authorizes, with the aim of consolidating the implementation of the peace agreement in its initial and most critical stages, the restoration of the strength of UNAVEM II to its previous level of 350 military observers and 126 police observers with an appropriate number of international and local staff, the deployment of such additional personnel to take place upon receipt of a report from the Secretary-General to the Council that the parties have initialled a peace agreement and that an effective cease-fire is in place;  
5.       Reaffirms its readiness to consider promptly, once the agreement to be concluded in Lusaka is formally signed, a report from the Secretary-General containing any recommendation for an expanded United Nations presence in Angola based on his assessment of the circumstances that warrant that, and welcomes the contingency planning done in this regard by the Secretary-General;  
6.       Deplores the continuation of military hostilities throughout Angola contrary to resolutions 922 (1994) , 932 (1994) , and 945 (1994) and reiterates its demand that both parties cease immediately all military operations;  
7.       Further deplores the deterioration in the humanitarian situation; condemns all acts, including the laying of land mines, that imperil or inhibit humanitarian relief efforts, and demands that both parties grant security clearances and guarantees for relief deliveries to all locations and refrain from any action which could jeopardize the safety of relief personnel or disrupt the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the Angolan people;  
8.       Reiterates in this context its demand for the immediate release by the responsible parties of the humanitarian relief workers who disappeared on 27 August 1994 and its call for the complete cooperation of the parties, especially UNITA, with the United Nations investigation into their disappearance;  
9.       Commends those States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations which have already contributed to the relief efforts, and appeals to all States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide further assistance to Angola to meet the growing humanitarian needs;  
10.     Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the Council is informed of further developments in the Lusaka Peace Talks and on the military and humanitarian situation in Angola; and to this end requests the Secretary-General to submit a report by 31 July 1994;  
14.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
