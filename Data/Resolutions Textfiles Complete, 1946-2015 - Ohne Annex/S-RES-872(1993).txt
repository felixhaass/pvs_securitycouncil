The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolve 812 (1993) of 12 March 1993 and 846 (1993) of 22 June 1993,  
Reaffirming also its resolution 868 (1993) of 29 September 1993 on the security of United Nations operations,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 24 September 1993 (S/26488 and Add.1),  
Welcoming the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement (including its Protocols) on 4 August 1993 and urging the parties to continue to comply fully with it,  
Noting the conclusion of the Secretary-General that in order to enable the United Nations to carry out its mandate successfully and effectively, the full cooperation of the parties with one another and with the Organization is required,  
Stressing the urgency of the deployment of an international neutral force in Rwanda, as underlined both by the Government of the Republic of Rwanda and by the Rwandese Patriotic Front and as reaffirmed by their joint delegation in New York,  
Paying tribute to the role played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in the conclusion of the Arusha Peace Agreement,  
Resolved that the United Nations should, at the request of the parties, and under peaceful conditions with the full cooperation of all the parties, make its full contribution to the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement,  
1.       Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General (S/26488);  
2.       Decides to establish a peace-keeping operation under the name United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) for a period of six months subject to the proviso that it will be extended beyond the initial ninety days only upon a review by the Council based on a report from the Secretary-General as to whether or not substantive progress has been made towards the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement;  
3.       Decides that drawing from the Secretary-General's recommendations, UNAMIR shall have the following mandate:  
(a)      To contribute to the security of the city of Kigali, inter alia, within a weapons secure area established by the parties in and around the city;  
(b)      To monitor observance of the cease-fire agreement, which calls for the establishment of cantonment and assembly zones and the demarcation of the new demilitarized zone and other demilitarization procedures;  
(c)      To monitor the security situation during the final period of the transitional government's mandate, leading up to the elections;  
(d)      To assist with mine clearance, primarily through training programmes;  
(e)      To investigate at the request of the parties or on its own initiative instances of alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement relating to the integration of the armed forces, and pursue any such instances with the parties responsible and report thereon as appropriate to the Secretary-General;  
(f)      To monitor the process of repatriation of Rwandese refugees and resettlement of displaced persons to verify that it is carried out in a safe and orderly manner;  
(g)      To assist in the coordination of humanitarian assistance activities in conjunction with relief operations;  
(h)      To investigate and report on incidents regarding the activities of the gendarmerie and police;  
4.       Approves the Secretary-General's proposal that the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR), established by resolution 816 (1993) , should be integrated within UNAMIR;  
5.       Welcomes the efforts and the cooperation of the OAU in helping to implement the Arusha Peace Agreement, in particular the integration of the Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG II) in UNAMIR;  
6.       Further approves the Secretary-General's proposal that the deployment and withdrawal of UNAMIR should be carried out in stages and notes, in this connection, that UNAMIR's mandate, if extended, is expected to terminate following national elections and the installation of a new government in Rwanda, events which are scheduled to occur by October 1995, but no later than December 1995;  
7.       Authorizes the Secretary-General, in this context, to deploy the first contingent, at the level specified by the Secretary-General's report, to Kigali for an initial period of six months, in the shortest possible time, which, when fully in place, will permit the establishment of the transitional institutions and implementation of the other relevant provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement;  
8.       Invites the Secretary-General, in the context of the report referred to in paragraph 2 above, also to report on the progress of UNAMIR following its initial deployment, and resolves to review, as appropriate, on the basis of that report and as part of the review referred to in paragraph 2 above, the requirement for further deployments in the scale and composition recommended by the Secretary-General in his report (S/26488);  
9.       Invites the Secretary-General to consider ways of reducing the total maximum strength of UNAMIR, in particular, through phased deployment without thereby affecting the capacity of UNAMIR to carry out its mandate and requests the Secretary-General in planning and executing the phased deployment of UNAMIR to seek economies and to report regularly on what is achieved in this regard;  
10.     Welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative who would lead UNAMIR in the field and exercise authority over all its elements;  
11.     Urges the parties to implement the Arusha Peace Agreement in good faith;  
12.     Also requests the Secretary-General to conclude expeditiously an agreement on the status of the operation, and all personnel engaged in the operation in Rwanda, to come into force as near as possible to the outset of the operation and no later than thirty days after the adoption of this resolution;  
13.     Demands that the parties take all appropriate steps to ensure the security and safety of the operation and personnel engaged in the operation;  
14.     Urges Member States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide and intensify their economic, financial and humanitarian assistance in favour of the Rwandese population and of the democratization process in Rwanda;  
15.     Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
