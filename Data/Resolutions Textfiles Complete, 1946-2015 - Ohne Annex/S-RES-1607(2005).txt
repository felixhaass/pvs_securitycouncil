Resolution 1607 (2005)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5208th meeting, on 21 June 2005
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and West Africa,
Taking note of the reports of the United Nations Panel of Experts on Liberia dated 17 March 2005 (S/2005/176) and 13 June 2005 (S/2005/360), and the report of the Secretary-General dated 7 June 2005 (S/2005/376), submitted pursuant to resolution 1579 (2004),
Recognizing the linkage between the illegal exploitation of natural resources such as diamonds and timber, illicit trade in such resources, and the proliferation and trafficking of arms and the recruitment and use of mercenaries as one of the sources of fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in West Africa, particularly in Liberia,
Recalling that the measures imposed under resolution 1521 (2003) were designed to prevent such illegal exploitation from fuelling a resumption of the conflict in Liberia, as well as to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the extension of the authority of the National Transitional Government throughout Liberia,
Expressing its concern that, while the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has contributed to the improvement of security throughout Liberia, the National Transitional Government has not yet established its authority throughout Liberia,
Emphasizing the need for the international community to help the National Transitional Government increase its capacity to establish its authority throughout Liberia, particularly to establish its control over the diamond- and timber-producing areas and Liberia's borders,
Expressing deep concern at information that former President Charles Taylor and others still closely associated with him continue to engage in activities that undermine peace and stability in Liberia and the region,
Having reviewed the measures imposed by paragraphs 2, 4, 6 and 10 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the progress

towards meeting the conditions set forth in paragraphs 5, 7 and 11 of resolution 1521 (2003),

Acknowledging the recent completion of the Forest Concession Review and welcoming the report of the Forest Concession Review Committee,

Taking note of the ongoing discussions regarding a Liberia Economic Governance Action Plan, designed to ensure prompt implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and to expedite the lifting of measures imposed by resolution 1521 (2003), and expressing its intention to consider, as appropriate, the Action Plan,
Emphasizing that, despite completion of demobilization and disarmament, significant challenges remain in completing reintegration and repatriation of excombatants and restructuring of the security sector, as well as establishing and maintaining stability in Liberia and the subregion,
