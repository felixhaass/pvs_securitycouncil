The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, especially resolutions 1918 (2010) and 1976 (2011),
Continuing to be gravely concerned by the growing threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels off the coast of Somalia pose to the situation in Somalia, States in the region and other States, as well as to international navigation, the safety of commercial maritime routes and the safety of seafarers and other persons, and also gravely concerned by the increased level of violence employed by pirates and persons involved in armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia,
Emphasizing the importance of finding a comprehensive solution to the problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia,
Stressing the need to build Somalia's potential for sustainable economic growth as a means to tackle the underlying causes of piracy, including poverty, thus contributing to a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia and illegal activities connected therewith,
Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia,
Reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Convention), in particular its articles 100, 101 and 105, sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities,
Further reaffirming that the provisions of this resolution apply only with respect to the situation in Somalia and do not affect the rights and obligations or responsibilities of Member States under international law,
Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and recognizing the commitment of signatory States to review their national legislation with a view to ensuring that national laws to criminalize piracy and armed robbery against ships, and adequate guidelines for the exercise of

jurisdiction, conduct of investigations, and prosecutions of alleged offenders, are in place,
Commending those States that have amended their domestic law in order to criminalize piracy and facilitate the prosecution of suspected pirates in their national courts, consistent with applicable international law, including human rights law, and stressing the need for States to continue their efforts in this regard,
Noting with concern at the same time that the domestic law of a number of States lacks provisions criminalizing piracy and/or procedural provisions for effective criminal prosecution of suspected pirates,
Reaffirming the importance of national prosecution of suspected pirates for combating piracy off the coast of Somalia,
Strongly condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking by suspected pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the inhuman conditions hostage face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on their families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of hostage-taking and the need for the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages,
Recognizing that despite the efforts to date by States to prosecute suspected pirates at the national level, the ongoing work in this regard is still insufficient and that more must be done to ensure that suspected pirates are effectively brought to justice,
Reiterating its concern over a large number of persons suspected of piracy having to be released without facing justice, reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti-piracy efforts of the international community and being determined to create conditions to ensure that pirates are held accountable,
Noting with interest the conclusion in the Secretary-General's report on the modalities for the establishment of specialized Somali anti-piracy courts (S/2011/360) that, assuming that sufficient international assistance is provided, piracy trials being conducted by courts in Somaliland and Puntland are expected to reach international standards in about three years, and expressing its hope consistent with the mentioned Secretary-General's report that this timeline will be accelerated if suitable experts, including those from the Somali diaspora, can be identified and recruited,
Welcoming the consultations between the United Nations and regional States, including the Seychelles, Mauritius, and Tanzania, and the willingness expressed by Tanzania to assist the international community, under the right conditions, to prosecute suspected pirates in its territory,
Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region,
1. Reaffirms that the ultimate goal of enhancing Somali responsibility and active involvement in efforts to prosecute suspected pirates, as emphasized by the Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Legal Issues Related to Piracy off the Coast
