Distr. GENERAL S/RES/1005 (1995) 17 July 1995

RESOLUTION 1005 (1995)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 3555th meeting, on 17 July 1995
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions 918 (1994) of 17 May 1994, and 997 (1995) of 9 June 1995,
Noting with concern that unexploded landmines constitute a substantial hazard to the population of Rwanda, and an impediment to the rapid reconstruction of the country,
Noting also the desire of the Government of Rwanda to address the problem of unexploded landmines, and the interest on the part of other States to assist with the detection and destruction of these mines,
Underlining the importance the Council attaches to efforts to eliminate the threat posed by unexploded landmines in a number of States, and the humanitarian nature of demining programmes,
Recognizing that safe and successful humanitarian demining operations in Rwanda will require the supply to Rwanda of an appropriate quantity of explosives for use in these operations,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
Decides that, notwithstanding the restrictions imposed in paragraph 13 of resolution 918 (1994), appropriate amounts of explosives intended exclusively for use in established humanitarian demining programmes may be supplied to Rwanda upon application to and authorization by the Committee of the Security Council established by resolution 918 (1994).
