The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolution 924 (1994) of 1 June 1994 on the situation in the Republic of Yemen (Yemen),  
Having Considered the report of the Secretary-General on the fact-finding mission to Yemen dated 27 June 1994 (S/1994/764),  
Welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy,  
Strongly supporting the Secretary-General's call for an immediate and complete halt to the shelling of the City of Aden, and condemning the failure to heed this call,  
Deeply disturbed that no cease-fire has been implemented or sustained despite several cease-fire declarations by both sides,  
Deeply concerned at the situation in Yemen, and, in particular, the deteriorating humanitarian situation in many parts of the country,  
Alarmed by reports of the continuing provision of arms and other materiel,  
1.       Reiterates its call for an immediate cease-fire;  
2.       Stresses the importance of the existence and effective implementation of a cease-fire covering all ground, naval and air operations, including provisions on the positioning of heavy weapons out of range of Aden;  
3.       Strongly deplores the infliction of civilian casualties and destruction resulting from the continuing military assault on Aden;  
4.       Requests the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy to continue talks under their auspices with all concerned, with a view to implementing a durable cease-fire and to the possible establishment of a mechanism acceptable to both sides, preferably involving countries of the region, to monitor, encourage respect for, and help to prevent violations of the cease-fire and to report to the Secretary-General;  
5.       Reiterates its call for an immediate cessation of the supply of arms and other materiel;  
6.       Reiterates that political differences cannot be resolved through the use of force, deeply regrets the failure of all concerned to resume their political dialogue and urges them to do so immediately and without preconditions, thus permitting a peaceful resolution of their differences and the restoration of peace and stability, and requests the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy to examine appropriate ways of facilitating these aims;  
7.       Expresses its deep concern at the humanitarian situation resulting from the conflict, requests the Secretary-General to use the resources at his disposal, including those of the relevant United Nations agencies, to address urgently the needs of those affected by the conflict, in particular the inhabitants of Aden and those displaced by the conflict, and urges all concerned to provide humanitarian access and facilitate the distribution of relief supplies to those in need wherever they may be located;  
8.       Requests the Secretary-General to provide a progress report to the Council on the implementation of the present resolution as soon as possible and in any event within 15 days of the adoption of this resolution;
