4. Welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, including on the political status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia, respecting fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, and the efforts undertaken by the Russian Federation in its capacity as facilitator, in particular during the last round of talks between the parties held in Moscow in June 1997, to continue to intensify the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict;
