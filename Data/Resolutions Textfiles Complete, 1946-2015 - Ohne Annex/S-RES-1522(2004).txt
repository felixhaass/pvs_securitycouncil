Adopted by the Security Council at its 4894th meeting, on 15 January 2004
The Security Council,
Recalling its previous resolutions and statements of its President concerning the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Encouraged by the progress achieved in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the conclusion of the Global and All Inclusive Agreement signed in Pretoria on 17 December 2002 and the subsequent establishment of the Government of National Unity and Transition,
Considering that the reform of the security sector, including the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants, the effective restructuring and integration of the armed forces of the former Congolese belligerents, and the establishment of an integrated national police, are key elements for the success of the transition process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Reaffirming, in this regard, that overall responsibility lies with the Government of National Unity and Transition, welcoming the establishment of an integrated High Command, and calling for an effective cooperation at all levels of the Congolese armed forces,
1. Welcomes the efforts currently undertaken to set up the first integrated and unified brigade in Kisangani as a step towards the elaboration and implementation of a comprehensive programme for the formation of a Congolese integrated national army;
2. Decides that, since the Government of National Unity and Transition has been established and is in place, its demand for the demilitarization of Kisangani and its surroundings laid down in paragraph 3 of resolution 1304 (2000) shall not apply to the restructured and integrated forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to the armed forces included in the comprehensive programme for the formation of an integrated and restructured national army;
3. Urges the Government of National Unity and Transition to take the appropriate measures, for the restructuring and integration of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in accordance with the Global and All Inclusive
