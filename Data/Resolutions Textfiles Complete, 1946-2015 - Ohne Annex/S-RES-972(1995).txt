4. Requests that the Secretary-General base any decision to return UNOMIL and its civilian staff to the level authorized under resolution 866 (1993) on the existence of an effective cease-fire and on the ability of UNOMIL to carry out its mandate;

8. Urges Member States to provide support for the peace process in Liberia by contributing to the United Nations Trust Fund for Liberia, and by providing financial, logistical and other assistance in support of the troops participating in ECOMOG in order to enable ECOMOG to deploy fully and to carry out its mandate, particularly with respect to encampment and disarmament of the Liberian factions;
