Noting with appreciation the important role played by the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability and paying tribute to its personnel in the performance of their mandate,
Taking into consideration that the security situation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continues to improve, but that peace and stability in the broader region have not yet been fully achieved, and expressing the hope that developments in the region will contribute to increased confidence and stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, permitting the further drawing down of UNPREDEP towards its conclusion,

Welcoming the continued cooperation between UNPREDEP and the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
