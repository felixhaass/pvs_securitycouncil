Resolution 2131 (2013)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 7089th meeting, on 18 December 2013
The Security Council,
Noting with concern that the situation in the Middle East is tense and is likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be reached,
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force of 3 December 2013 (S/2013/716), and also reaffirming its resolution 1308 (2000) of 17 July 2000,
Stressing that both parties must abide by the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and scrupulously observe the ceasefire,
Concurring with the Secretary-General's findings that the ongoing military activities conducted by any actor in the area of separation continue to have the potential to escalate tensions between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic, jeopardize the ceasefire between the two countries, and pose a risk to the local civilian population and United Nations personnel on the ground,
Expressing grave concern at all violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement,
Stressing that there should be no military forces in the area of separation other than those of UNDOF,
Strongly condemning the recent intense fighting in the area of separation and calling on all parties to the Syrian domestic conflict to cease military actions in the UNDOF area of operation, noting in particular the significant confrontations of 12 and 16 September and of 1 to 4 October, and the increased use by elements of the Syrian opposition and other groups of improvised explosive devices in the UNDOF area of operation,
Strongly condemning the incidents threatening the safety and security of United Nations personnel in recent months, including fighting on 1 October in the vicinity of Khan Arnabeh that resulted in an injury to UNDOF personnel, the firing on UNDOF vehicles carrying mission personnel on 15 October and 5 November by the Syrian Arab Armed Forces in Al Samdaniyah village and in the vicinity of Jaba
