The Security Council,  
Reaffirming its resolutions 849 (1993) of 9 July 1993, 854 (1993) of 6 August 1993, 858 (1993) of 24 August 1993 and 876 (1993) of 19 October 1993,  
Recalling in particular resolution 858 (1993) of 24 August 1993, in which the Council decided to establish a United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG),  
Having considered the Secretary-General's report of 27 October 1993 (S/26646) concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia,  
Noting with concern that the original mandate of UNOMIG has been overtaken by the military developments of 16 to 27 September 1993,  
Expressing its serious concern that continuation of the conflict in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, threatens peace and stability in the region,  
1.       Welcomes the Secretary-General's report of 27 October 1993;  
2.       Welcomes also the continued efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy, in cooperation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and with the assistance of the Government of the Russian Federation as facilitator, to carry forward the peace process with the aim of achieving an overall political settlement, and in particular to bring both parties together in late November 1993 in Geneva;  
3.       Reiterates the demand in its resolution 876 (1993) that all the parties to the conflict in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, refrain from the use of force and from any violation of international humanitarian law, and looks forward to the report of the fact-finding mission sent by the Secretary-General to the Republic of Georgia in this regard;  
4.       Approves the continued presence of UNOMIG in Georgia until 31 January 1994 comprising up to five military observers plus minimal support staff, with the following interim mandate:  
(a)      to maintain contacts with both sides to the conflict and military contingents of the Russian Federation;  
(b)      to monitor the situation and report to headquarters, with particular reference to any developments relevant to the efforts of the United Nations to promote a comprehensive political settlement;  
5.       Decides that UNOMIG will not be extended beyond 31 January 1994 unless the Secretary-General reports to the Council that substantive progress has been made towards implementing measures aimed at establishing a lasting peace or that the peace process will be served by the prolongation of its mandate, and requests the Secretary-General to report as appropriate, but in any event by late January 1994, on the activities of UNOMIG;  
6.       Requests the Secretary-General to take planning steps which would enable, upon a further decision by the Council, prompt deployment of additional personnel within the originally authorized strength of UNOMIG if the Secretary-General reports that the situation on the ground and in the peace process warrants it;  
7.       Decides to remain seized of the matter.
