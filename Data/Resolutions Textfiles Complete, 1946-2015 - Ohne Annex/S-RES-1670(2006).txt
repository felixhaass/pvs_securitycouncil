Distr.: General 13 April 2006

Resolution 1670 (2006)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 5410th meeting, on 13 April 2006
The Security Council,
Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements pertaining to the situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the requirements contained therein, including in particular resolutions 1640 (2005) of 23 November 2005 and 1661 (2006) of 14 March 2006, as well as the statement of its President of 24 February 2006 (S/PRST/2006/10),
Stressing its unwavering commitment to the peace process, and to the full and expeditious implementation of the Algiers Agreements,
Stressing further that lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea (hereinafter referred to as "the parties") as well as in the region cannot be achieved without the full demarcation of the border between the two parties, and recalling that both parties have agreed to accept the determinations of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) as final and binding,
Reaffirming its strong commitment to ensure that the two parties permit the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to perform its duties without restrictions and provide UNMEE with the necessary access, assistance, support and protection required for the performance of these duties, and in this regard stressing that demarcation of the border cannot proceed unless UNMEE is allowed full freedom of movement throughout its area of operations,
Welcoming once again the successful convening of the meeting of the Witnesses to the Algiers Agreements on 22 February 2006 in New York, as well as the convening of the EEBC meeting on 10 March 2006 in London and looking forward to the next EEBC meeting,
Stressing that the unacceptable restrictions on UNMEE, which must be lifted, have drastically reduced the operational capacity for the Mission and could lead to serious implications for the Mission's future,
Commending the role of UNMEE and expressing once again its deep appreciation for the contribution and dedication of the troop-contributing countries to the work of UNMEE, despite the immense difficulties which they are facing,
