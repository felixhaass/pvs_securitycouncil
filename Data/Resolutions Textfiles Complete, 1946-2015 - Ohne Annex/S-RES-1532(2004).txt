Distr.: General 12 March 2004

Resolution 1532 (2004)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 4925th meeting, on 12 March 2004
The Security Council,
Recalling its resolution 1521 (2003) of 22 December 2003, and its other previous resolutions and statements by its President on the situation in Liberia and West Africa,
Noting with concern that the actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their depletion of Liberian resources, and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property from that country, have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources,
Recognizing the negative impact on Liberia of the transfer abroad of misappropriated funds and assets and the need for the international community to ensure as soon as possible, in accordance with paragraph 6 below, the return of such funds and assets to Liberia,
Also expressing concern that former President Taylor, in collaboration with others still closely associated with him, continues to exercise control over and to have access to such misappropriated funds and property, with which he and his associates are able to engage in activities that undermine peace and stability in Liberia and the region,
Determining that this situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security in West Africa, in particular to the peace process in Liberia,
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
1. Decides that, to prevent former Liberian President Charles Taylor, his immediate family members, in particular Jewell Howard Taylor and Charles Taylor, Jr., senior officials of the former Taylor regime, or other close allies or associates as designated by the Committee established by paragraph 21 of resolution 1521 (2003) (hereinafter, "the Committee") from using misappropriated funds and property to interfere in the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia and the sub-region, all States in which there are, at the date of adoption of this resolution or at any time thereafter, funds, other financial assets and economic resources owned or controlled
