Adopted by the Security Council at its 7170th meeting, on 8 May 2014
The Security Council,
Recalling Article 24 of the United Nations Charter which confers upon the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,
Recognizing the medals presented by the United Nations to those men and women in uniform who serve in United Nations field operations, and recalling its Resolution 1121 (1997) establishing the Dag Hammarskjold Medal, as a tribute to the sacrifice of those who have lost their own lives as a result of service in peacekeeping operations, under the operational control and authority of the United nations,
Recalling fundamental principles of the United Nations peacekeeping, as well as other relevant principles of the United Nations activities on the ground,

Recognizing with the deepest regret, how the family of Captain Diagne never received, after his death, any expressions of appreciation from the headquarters of the United Nations for the sacrifices made by their distinguished family member,

Decides to create "the Captain Mbaye Diagne Medal for Exceptional Courage" to be awarded to those military, police, civilian United Nations personnel and associated personnel who demonstrate exceptional courage, in the face of extreme danger, while fulfilling the mandate of their missions or their functions, in the service of humanity and the United Nations;
2. Requests the Secretary-General to establish within six months after the adoption of this resolution, the design of the medal, and to submit in due course to
