The Security Council,  
Reaffirming all its previous resolutions on the situation in Rwanda, in particular its resolution 872 (1993) of 5 October 1993 by which it established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),  
Recalling its resolution 909 (1994) of 5 April 1994, which extended the mandate of UNAMIR until 29 July 1994 with a six-week review provision on the understanding that progress would be made in establishing the transitional institutions provided for under the Arusha Peace Agreement between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front,  
Recalling also its statement of 7 April 1994 (S/PRST/1994/16) which, inter alia, reaffirmed its commitment to the Arusha Peace Agreement and urged all parties to implement it fully,  
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 April 1994 (S/1994/470),  
Stressing that the Arusha Peace Agreement remains central to the peace process in Rwanda,  
Expressing deep regret at the failure of the parties to implement fully the provisions of the Arusha Peace Agreement, particularly those provisions relating to the cease-fire,  
Recognizing the initiatives made by the late Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi towards resolving the problems in their countries through peaceful means and in collaboration with regional leaders,  
Shocked at the tragic incident that resulted in the deaths of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi on 6 April 1994,  
Appalled at the ensuing large-scale violence in Rwanda, which has resulted in the death of thousands of innocent civilians, including women and children, the displacement of a significant number of the Rwandese population, including those who sought refuge with UNAMIR, and the significant increase in refugees to neighbouring countries,  
Deeply concerned by continuing fighting, looting, banditry and the breakdown of law and order, particularly in Kigali,  
Stressing the need for all countries to avoid any action that might exacerbate the situation in Rwanda,  
Expressing its deep concern for the safety and security of UNAMIR and other United Nations personnel, and personnel of non-governmental organizations who are assisting in implementing the peace process and in distributing humanitarian relief,  
1.       Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 20 April 1994;

(a)      To act as an intermediary between the parties in an attempt to secure their agreement to a cease-fire;  
(b)      To assist in the resumption of humanitarian relief operations to the extent feasible; and  
(c)      To monitor and report on developments in Rwanda, including the safety and security of the civilians who sought refuge with UNAMIR,  
and authorizes a force level as set out in paragraphs 15 to 18 of the Secretary-General's report of 20 April 1994 for that purpose;  
9.       Decides to keep the situation in Rwanda under constant review and states its readiness to consider promptly any recommendations which the Secretary-General may make concerning the force level and mandate of UNAMIR in the light of developments;
